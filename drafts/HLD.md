XXX define heavy-light decomposition (both kinds).  Let $s(t)$ be the
size (total number of nodes) of a tree.
Given a tree $t$:

- Select a child $c$ of $t$ such that $s(c) \geq s(t)/2$ (if there is one).
- Select the child $c$ of largest size.

XXX I may write more about this in a later blog post.  for fun, can
you prove: (1) using criterion 1, any path from the root to a leaf encounters at most
$\lg(n)$ heavy paths; (2) the paths generated by criterion 2 contain
all those generated by criterion 1 as subpaths.

<!-- The first selection criterion is simple to reason about.  First, note -->
<!-- that there can be at most one child satisfying the criterion (if there -->
<!-- were two, the size of $t$ would be at least $2\cdot(s(t)/2) + 1$, -->
<!-- which is absurd).  Note also that every time we move from a node to a -->
<!-- non-selected child (*i.e.* a child which is the start of a new, -->
<!-- distinct path), the size of the current subtree decreases by a factor -->
<!-- of at least 2;  -->
