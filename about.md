I'm Brent Yorgey. I am an associate professor in the [department of
mathematics and computer science](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/) at
[Hendrix College](http://www.hendrix.edu/) in Conway, Arkansas,
USA. My academic/professional interests include functional programming
languages (especially [Haskell](http://haskell.org/)), type systems,
category theory, combinatorics, discrete mathematics in general, and
computer science and [mathematics
education](http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/). Other interests include
music (I am a classical and jazz pianist), Go, bridge, and classical
Greek and Hebrew.

The best way to contact me is by sending email to

I also often hang out on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) as `byorgey`.

I do not have any social media accounts.
