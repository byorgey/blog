I'm Brent Yorgey. I am an associate professor in the [department of

USA. My academic/professional interests include functional programming
languages (especially [Haskell](http://haskell.org/)), type systems,
category theory, combinatorics, discrete mathematics in general, and
computer science and [mathematics
education](http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/). Other interests include
