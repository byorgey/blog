Although the official deadline has passed, I hear there are still a few spots left for the <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/">Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS)</a>, hosted at the University of Oregon in Eugene. This is a really fantastic opportunity to take a deep dive in programming languages and type theory. I attended as a graduate student and although it was overwhelming at times—like drinking from a fire hose!—it was a wonderful experience. I made some great friends and learned a ton (I still occasionally refer back to my notes!). Eugene is also beautiful in the summer (I have fond memories of going geocaching in a nearby park).
</p>
<p>
The main summer school (July 9–21) has a focus on parallelism and concurrency, but for those with less background, there is also a one-week introduction on the foundations of programming languages (July 3–8). If you want, you can actually choose to attend <strong>only</strong> the July 3–8 session (or both, or just July 9–21 of course). Attending just the introductory session could be a great option for someone who knows some functional programming but wants a more solid grounding in the underlying theory.
</p>
<p>
If you’re a member of the Haskell/FP community who is thinking of applying, and I’m familiar with you or your work, I would be happy to write you a recommendation if you need one.
