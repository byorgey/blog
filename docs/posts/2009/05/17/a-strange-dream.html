<p>Last night I dreamed that my dad had this really dangerous pet lizard (it was poisonous and really strong—kind of like a Komodo dragon but somewhat smaller). My dad was gone and it started to get really agitated and angry—it was jumping up on people and running all over the place and we were afraid it was going to maim someone. I finally tricked it into going into the microwave and slammed the door shut, but it was trying to get out and it took all my strength to keep it inside. Since it was my dad’s pet we didn’t want to hurt it, but eventually there was no alternative—I couldn’t hold it in the microwave much longer and it was definitely going to hurt someone if it got out. You can probably guess what I did next.</p>
<p>That’s right, I multiplied it by 3000, and it turned into a bunch of random bits. Problem solved!</p>
