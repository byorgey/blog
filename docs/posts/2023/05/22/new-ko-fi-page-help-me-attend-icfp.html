<h1>New ko-fi page: help me attend ICFP!</h1>

<section>
<p>
<strong>tl;dr</strong>: if you appreciate my past or ongoing contributions to the Haskell community, please consider helping me get to ICFP by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/byorgey">donating via my new ko-fi page</a>!
</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/I3I5KYUQX"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg" alt="ko-fi" /></a></p>
</div>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Working at a <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/">small liberal arts institution</a> has some tremendous benefits (close interaction with motivated students, freedom to pursue the projects I want rather than jump through a bunch of hoops to get tenure, fantastic colleagues), and I love my job. But there are also downsides; the biggest ones for me are the difficulty of securing enough travel funding, and, relatedly, the difficulty of cultivating and maintaining collaborations.
</p>
<p>
I would really like to be able to attend <a href="https://icfp23.sigplan.org/">ICFP in Seattle this September</a>; the last time I was able to attend ICFP in person was 2019 in Berlin. With transportation, lodging, food, and registration fees, it will probably come to about $3000. I can get a grant from my instutition to pay for up to $1200, but that still leaves a big gap.
</p>
<p>
As I was brainstorming other sources of funding, it dawned on me that there are probably many people who have been positively impacted by my contributions to the Haskell community (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/">CIS 194</a>, the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a>, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">diagrams</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split">split</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MonadRandom">MonadRandom</a>, <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/">burrito metaphors</a>…) and/or would like to support my ongoing work (<a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/category/competitive-programming/">competitive programming in Haskell</a>, <a href="https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/#readme">swarm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/#readme">disco</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/user/BrentYorgey">ongoing package maintenance</a>…) and would be happy to donate a bit.
</p>
<p>
So, to that end, I have set up a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/byorgey">ko-fi page</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If you have been positively impacted by my contributions and would like to help me get to ICFP this fall, one-time donations — even very small amounts — are greatly appreciated! I’m not going to promise any particular rewards, but if you’re at ICFP I will definitely find you to say thanks!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Thinking beyond this fall, ideally this could even become a reliable source of funding to help me travel to ICFP or other collaboration opportunities every year. To that end, if you’re willing to sign up for a recurring monthly donation, that would be amazing — think of it as supporting my ongoing work: <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/category/competitive-programming/">blog posts</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/cpih">book</a>) on competitive programming in Haskell, <a href="https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/#readme">Swarm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/#readme">Disco</a> development, and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/user/BrentYorgey">ongoing package maintenance</a>. I will <a href="https://ko-fi.com/byorgey/posts">post updates on ko-fi</a> with things I’m thinking about and working on; I am also going to try to publish more frequent blog posts, at least in the near term.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thank you, friends — I hope to see many people in Seattle! Next up: back to your regularly scheduled competitive programming!
</p>
