<em>This is certainly not a new observation, and I’m sure it is folklore and/or contained in various textbooks, but it was amusing to derive it independently.</em>
</p>
<p>
Suppose we have a finite set of real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}\)</span>, and we want to pick a value <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> which is somehow “in the middle” of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. The punchline is that
</p>
<ul>
<li>
if we want to minimize the sum of the <em>squared</em> distances from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to each <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>, we should pick <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to be the <em>average</em> of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>;
</li>
<li>
if we want to minimize the sum of the <em>absolute</em> distances from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to each <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>, we should pick <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to be the <em>median</em> of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first of these is tricky to understand intuitively but easy to derive; the second is intuitively straightforward but trying to derive it leads to an interesting twist.
</p>
<h2 id="average-minimizing-sum-of-squared-distances">
Average = minimizing sum of squared distances
</h2>
<p>
Let’s not worry about <em>why</em> we would want to minimize the sum of <em>squared</em> distances; there are good reasons and it’s not the point. I don’t know about you, but I find it difficult to reason intuitively about how and why to pick <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to minimize this sum of squared differences. If you know of an intuitive way to explain this, I would love to hear about it! But in any case, it is easy to derive using some strightforward calculus.
</p>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle S(m) = \sum_i(m - x_i)^2\)</span> denote the sum of squared distances from a given <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to each of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. Taking the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, we find
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dm} S(m) = \sum_i 2(m - x_i)\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we can first divide through by the factor of 2, yielding
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle 0 = \sum_i (m - x_i)\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
Since <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, this is just <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> copies of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> less the sum of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. Hence, solving for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> yields
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle m = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
as expected: the value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> which minimizes the sum of squared distances to the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is their average, that is, the sum of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> divided by the size of the set.
</p>
<h2 id="median-minimizing-sum-of-absolute-distances">
Median = minimizing sum of absolute distances
</h2>
<p>
Now suppose we want to minimize the sum of <em>absolute</em> distances instead, that is,
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(S(m) = \sum_i |m - x_i|\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
In this scenario, it is much easier to reason out the correct answer. Start with some arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and imagine nudging it by some small amount <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>, say, to the right. <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>’s distances to any points on its left will each increase by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>, and its distances to any points on its right will each decrease by the same amount. Therefore, if there are more <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> to the left of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then the overall sum of distances distances will increase; if there are more <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> to the right, then the overall sum will decrease. So, to find <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> which minimizes the sum of absolute differences, we want the same number of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> on the left and the right, that is, we want the <em>median</em>. Note that if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, then we must pick <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to be exactly equal to the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> in the middle; if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, then we can pick <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to be anywhere inside the interval between the middle two <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
Just for fun, can we derive this answer using calculus, like we did for minimizing squared differences? There is a wrinkle, of course, which is that the absolute value function is not differentiable everywhere: it has a sharp corner at zero. But we won’t let that stop us! Clearly the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x &amp;lt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x &amp;gt; 0\)</span>. So it seems reasonable to just assign the derivative a value of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>. Algebraically, we can define
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} |x| = [x &amp;gt; 0] - [x &amp;lt; 0]\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
where <span class="math inline">\([P]\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> when the proposition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> when it is false (this notation is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket"><em>Iverson bracket</em></a>). So when <span class="math inline">\(x &amp;gt; 0\)</span> we get <span class="math inline">\([x &amp;gt; 0] - [x &amp;lt; 0] = 1 - 0 = 1\)</span>; when <span class="math inline">\(x &amp;lt; 0\)</span> we get <span class="math inline">\(0 - 1 = -1\)</span>; and when <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> both propositions are false so we get <span class="math inline">\(0 - 0 = 0\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
Armed with this definition, we can differentiate <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>:
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dm} S(m) = \frac{d}{dm} \sum_i |m - x_i| = \sum_i [m &amp;gt; x_i] - \sum_i [m &amp;lt; x_i]\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
Clearly, this is zero when <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \sum_i [m &amp;gt; x_i] = \sum_i [m &amp;lt; x_i]\)</span>, that is, when there are the same number of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> on either side of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
The curious thing to me is that even though the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> is undefined when <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>, it seems like it “wants” to be 0 here. In general, if we assign the value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to the derivative at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> becomes
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dm} S(m) = \sum_i [m &amp;gt; x_i] + k \sum_i [m = x_i] - \sum_i [m &amp;lt; x_i]\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
When <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is nonzero and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, there are no values of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for which this derivative is zero, making it more difficult to find the minimum.
