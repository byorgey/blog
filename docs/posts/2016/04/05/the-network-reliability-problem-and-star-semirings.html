<p>
In a <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2016/02/19/the-network-reliability-problem.html">previous post</a> I defined the <em>network reliability</em> problem. Briefly, we are given a directed graph whose edges are labelled with probabilities, which we can think of as giving the likelihood of a message successfully traversing a link in a network. The problem is then to compute the probability that a message will successfully traverse the network from a given source node to a given target node.
</p>
<p>
Several commenters pointed out the connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian networks</a>. I think they are right, and the network reliability problem is a very special case of Bayesian inference. However, so far this hasn’t seemed to help very much, since the things I can find about algorithms for Bayesian inference are either too general (<em>e.g.</em> allowing arbitrary functions at nodes) or too specific (<em>e.g.</em> only working for certain kinds of trees). So I’m going to put aside Bayesian inference for now; perhaps later I can come back to it.
</p>
<p>
In any case, <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2016/02/19/the-network-reliability-problem.html#comment-15064">Derek Elkins also made a comment</a> which pointed to exactly what I wanted to talk about next.
</p>
<h1 id="star-semirings-and-path-independence">
Star semirings and path independence
</h1>
<p>
Consider the related problem of computing the reliability of the <em>single most reliable path</em> from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in a network. This is really just a disguised version of the shortest path problem, so one can solve it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">Dijkstra’s algorithm</a>. But I want to discuss a more general way to think about solving it, using the theory of star semirings. Recall that a <em>semiring</em> is a set with two associative binary operations, “addition” and “multiplication”, which is a commutative monoid under addition, a monoid under multiplication, and where multiplication distributes over addition and <span class="math inline">\(0a = a0 = 0\)</span>. A <em>star semiring</em> is a semiring with an additional operation <span class="math inline">\((-)^*\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(a^* = 1 + aa^* = 1 + a^*a\)</span>. Intuitively, <span class="math inline">\(a^* = 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + \dots\)</span> (though <span class="math inline">\(a^*\)</span> can still be well-defined even when this infinite sum is not; we can at least say that <em>if</em> the infinite sum is defined, they must be equal). If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a star semiring, then the semiring of <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> matrices over <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is also a star semiring; for details see <span class="citation">Dolan (2013)</span>, <span class="citation">O’Connor (2011)</span>, <span class="citation">Penaloza (2005)</span>, and <span class="citation">Lehmann (1977)</span>. In particular, there is a very nice functional algorithm for computing <span class="math inline">\(M^*\)</span>, with time complexity <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> <span class="citation">(Dolan 2013)</span>. (Of course, this is slower than Dijkstra’s algorithm, but unlike Dijkstra’s algorithm it also works for finding shortest paths in the presence of negative edge weights—in which case it is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd-Warshall_algorithm">Floyd-Warshall algorithm</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Now, given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G = (V,E)\)</span> and labelling <span class="math inline">\(\varphi : E \to \mathbb{P}\)</span>, define the <span class="math inline">\(|V| \times |V|\)</span> adjacency matrix <span class="math inline">\(M_G\)</span> to be the matrix of edge probabilities, that is, <span class="math inline">\((M_G)_{uv} = \varphi(u,v)\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{P}, \max, 0, \times, 1)\)</span> be the star semiring of probabilities under maximum and multiplication (where <span class="math inline">\(a^* = 1\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(1 = \max(1,a \times 1)\)</span>). Then we can solve the single most reliable path problem by computing <span class="math inline">\(M_G^*\)</span> over this semiring, and finding the largest entry. If we want to find the actual most reliable path, and not just its reliability, we can instead work over the semiring <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P} \times E^*\)</span>, <em>i.e.</em> probabilities paired with paths. You might enjoy working out what the addition, multiplication, and star operations should be, or see <span class="citation">O’Connor (2011)</span>.
</p>
<p>
In fact, as shown by O’Connor and Dolan, there are many algorithms that can be recast as computing the star of a matrix, for an appropriate choice of semiring: for example, (reflexive-)transitive closure; all-pairs shortest paths; Gaussian elimination; dataflow analysis; and solving certain knapsack problems. One might hope that there is similarly an appropriate semiring for the network reliability problem. But I have spent some time thinking about this and I do not know of one.
</p>
<p>
Consider again the simple example given at the start of the <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2016/02/19/the-network-reliability-problem.html">previous post</a>:
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/0c0251dc858b7992.png" />
</p>
</div>
<p>
For this example, we computed the reliability of the network to be <span class="math inline">\(0.835\)</span>, by computing the probability of the upper path, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.45\)</span>, and the lower path, <span class="math inline">\(q = 0.7\)</span>, and then combining them as <span class="math inline">\(p + q - pq\)</span>, the probability of success on either path less the double-counted probability of simultaneous success on both.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by this example, one thing we might try would be to define operations <span class="math inline">\(p \land q = pq\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p \lor q = p + q - pq\)</span>. But when we go to check the semiring laws, we run into a problem: distributivity does not hold! <span class="math inline">\(p \land (q \lor r) = p(q + r - qr) = pq + pr - pqr\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\((p \land q) \lor (p \land r) = pq \lor pr = pq + pr - p^2qr\)</span>. The problem is that the addition operation <span class="math inline">\(p \lor q = p + q - pq\)</span> implicitly assumes that the events with probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are <em>independent</em>: otherwise the probability that they both happen is not actually equal to <span class="math inline">\(pq\)</span>. The events with probabilities <span class="math inline">\(pq\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(pr\)</span>, however, are <em>not</em> independent. In graph terms, they represent two paths with a shared subpath. In fact, our example computation at the beginning of the post was only correct since the two paths from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> were completely independent.
</p>
<h1 id="graph-reduction">
Graph reduction
</h1>
<p>
We can at least compute the reliability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series-parallel_graph">series-parallel graphs</a> whose terminals correspond with <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> consists of a single edge, return that edge’s probability.
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a composition of two subgraphs, whose reliabilities we recursively compute. Then:
<ul>
<li>
If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a sequential composition of graphs, return the product of their reliabilities.
</li>
<li>
If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a parallel composition of two graphs with reliabilities <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, return <span class="math inline">\(p + q - pq\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the second case, having a parallel composition of graphs ensures that there are no shared edges between them, so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are indeed independent.
</p>
<p>
Of course, many interesting graphs are not series-parallel. The simplest graph for which the above does not work looks like this:
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p>
<img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/25b7575a4c860ccd.png" />
</p>
</div>
<p>
Suppose all the edges have probability <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span>. Can you find the reliability of this network?
</p>
<p>
More in a future post!
