<section>
<p>The other day I was just sort of letting my mind wander, and I came up with an interesting monoid, which I’m calling the “monoid of partial knowledge”. So I thought I’d write about it here, partly just because it’s interesting, and partly to see whether anyone has any pointers to any literature (I’m sure I’m not the first to come up with it).</p>
<p>Recall that a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Monoid"><i>monoid</i></a> is a set with an associative binary operation and a distinguished element which is the identity for the operation.</p>
<p>Now, given a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Total_order"><i>total order</i></a> on a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with a smallest element <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, we get a monoid <span class="math inline">\((S, \max)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span> denotes the function which determines the larger of two elements, according to the total order on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span> is clearly associative, and has identity <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. Taking a list of elements of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and summarizing it via this monoid corresponds to finding the maximum element in the list. If you think of receiving the elements of the list one by one, and applying <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span> to each new incoming value and the value of an accumulator (storing the result back into the accumulator, which should obviously be initialized to <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>), at any given time the value of the accumulator represents the ‘current best’, i.e. the largest element among those received so far.</p>
<p>The idea I had was to generalize this from a total order to a preorder. Recall that a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Preorder"><i>preorder</i></a> is a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> equipped with a reflexive, transitive binary relation, often denoted <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span>. That is, for any <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z \in S\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim x\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim y \land y \lesssim z\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim z\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span> is also antisymmetric, that is, <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim y \land y \lesssim x\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>, it is called a <i>partial order</i>, or <i>poset</i>. Then if <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \lesssim x\)</span> for any two elements <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we get a total order, but for a general preorder some pairs of elements may not be comparable – that is, there may be elements <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for which neither <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim y\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(y \lesssim x\)</span> holds.</p>
<p>Let’s think about this. Suppose we are given a preorder <span class="math inline">\((P,\lesssim)\)</span> with an <i>initial object</i> <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> (an initial object in this context is an element which is <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span> all other elements). We’ll initialize an accumulator to <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, and imagine receiving elements of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> one at a time. For a concrete example, suppose we are dealing with the preorder (actually also a poset) of positive integers under the divisibility relation, so our accumulator is initialized to 1. Let’s say we receive the integer 4. Clearly, 1 divides 4, so we should replace the 1 in our accumulator with 4. But now suppose we next receive the integer 5. 4 does not divide 5 or vice versa, so what should we do? We would be justified in neither throwing the 5 away nor replacing the 4, since 4 and 5 are not related to each other under the divisibility relation. Somehow we need to keep the 4 <i>and</i> the 5 around.</p>
<p>The solution is that instead of creating a monoid over <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> itself, as we can for sets with a total order, we create a monoid over <i>subsets</i> of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. In particular, consider the set <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> which do not contain two distinct elements <span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim y\)</span>. Since we are dealing with subsets of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we can actually drop the restriction that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> contain an initial object; the empty set will serve as the identity for the monoid.</p>
<p>We then define the monoid operation <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> on two such subsets as</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S \oplus T = (S \triangleleft T) \cup (S \triangleright T)\)</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S \triangleleft T = \{ s \in S \mid \forall t \in T, s = t \mbox{ or } t \lesssim s \mbox{ or } s \not \lesssim t \}\)</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S \triangleright T = \{ t \in T \mid \forall s \in S, s = t \mbox{ or } t \not \lesssim s \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words, we combine subsets <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by forming the set of objects from <span class="math inline">\(S \cup T\)</span> which are not <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span> any others, with the exception of objects <span class="math inline">\(s \in S, t \in T\)</span> where both <span class="math inline">\(s \lesssim t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t \lesssim s\)</span>; in this case we keep <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This introduces a “left bias” to <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span>; there is also an equally valid version with right bias (in particular, <span class="math inline">\(S \oplus' T = (T \triangleleft S) \cup (T \triangleright S)\)</span>).</p>
<p>Now, let’s show that this really does define a valid monoid. First, we need to show that <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> is closed over <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(S, T \in P_*\)</span>. Suppose also that <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in S \oplus T\)</span> are distinct elements of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x \lesssim y\)</span>; we’ll derive a contradiction. First, we cannot have <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in S\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in T\)</span> by definition of <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span>. Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(x \in T, y \in S\)</span>. The fact that <span class="math inline">\(x \in S \oplus T\)</span> together with the definition of <span class="math inline">\(S \triangleright T\)</span> imply that we must have <span class="math inline">\(x \not \lesssim y\)</span>, a contradiction. Finally, suppose <span class="math inline">\(x \in S, y \in T\)</span>. Again, by the definition of <span class="math inline">\(S \triangleright T\)</span> we must have <span class="math inline">\(y \not \lesssim x\)</span>. But then the fact that <span class="math inline">\(x \in S \oplus T\)</span>, together with the definition of <span class="math inline">\(S \triangleleft T\)</span> and the facts that <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \not \lesssim x\)</span> imply that <span class="math inline">\(x \not \lesssim y\)</span>, a contradiction again. Hence <span class="math inline">\(S \oplus T\)</span> contains no such pair of elements.</p>
<p>The fact that the empty set <span class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span> is the identity for <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> is clear. (Incidentally, this is why we require that none of the sets in <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> contain two distinct elements with one <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span> the other: if <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> were such a set, we would have <span class="math inline">\(\varnothing \oplus S \neq S\)</span>.) I leave the associativity of <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> as an exercise for the reader (translation: this post is already getting long, the associativity of <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> seems intuitively obvious to me, and I don’t feel like formalizing it at the moment – perhaps I’ll try writing it up later). I also leave as an interesting exercise the following theorem: if <span class="math inline">\(S, T \in P_*\)</span> are both finite and nonempty, then <span class="math inline">\(S \oplus T\)</span> is also finite and nonempty.</p>
<p>In our example from before, we could now begin with <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> in our accumulator. After receiving the singleton set <span class="math inline">\(\{4\}\)</span>, our accumulator would have that singleton set as its new value. Upon receiving <span class="math inline">\(\{5\}\)</span>, our accumulator would become <span class="math inline">\(\{4,5\}\)</span>. Receiving <span class="math inline">\(\{10\}\)</span> would result in <span class="math inline">\(\{4,10\}\)</span> (5 divides 10, so the 5 is discarded); if we later received <span class="math inline">\(\{20\}\)</span>, we would simply have <span class="math inline">\(\{20\}\)</span> in our accumulator (both 4 and 10 divide 20).</p>
<p>I like to think of this as the monoid of <i>partial knowledge</i>. If we consider <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to be a set of facts or beliefs, some better (more reliable, useful, correct, complete, etc.) than others, then elements of <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> correspond to possible sets of beliefs. <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> describes how a set of beliefs changes upon encountering a new set of facts; some of the new facts may supersede and replace old ones, some may not impart any new information, and some may be completely new facts that aren’t related to any currently known.</p>
<p>Now, why can this be thought of as a generalization of the monoid <span class="math inline">\((P, \max)\)</span> on a totally ordered set? Well, look what happens when we replace <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in the definitions above with a totally ordered set with relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>: first of all, the restriction on <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> (no two elements of a set in <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> should be related by <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>) means that <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> contains only the empty set and singleton sets, so (ignoring the empty set) <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Now look at the definition of <span class="math inline">\(S \triangleleft T\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span> replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> (and <span class="math inline">\(\not \lesssim\)</span> replaced by <span class="math inline">\(&amp;gt;\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S \triangleleft T = \{ s \in S \mid \forall t \in T, s = t \mbox{ or } t \leq s \mbox{ or } s &amp;gt; t \}\)</span></p>
<p>But <span class="math inline">\(s = t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s &amp;gt; t\)</span> are both subsumed by <span class="math inline">\(t \leq s\)</span>, so we can rewrite this as</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\{s\} \triangleleft \{t\} = \{s\} \mbox{ if } s \geq t, \mbox{ or } \varnothing \mbox{ otherwise }\)</span>.</p>
<p>An analysis of <span class="math inline">\(\triangleright\)</span> is similar, and it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(\{s\} \oplus \{t\} = \{\max(s,t)\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>I note in passing that although it might appear shady that I swept that “ignoring the empty set” bit under the rug, everything really does check out: technically, to see a direct generalization of <span class="math inline">\((P,\max)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((P_*, \oplus)\)</span>, we can require that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> have an initial object and that <span class="math inline">\(P_*\)</span> contains only finite, nonempty sets. Then it requires a bit more work to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> is closed, but it still goes through. I used the formulation I did since it seems more general and requires less proving.</p>
<p>Anyway, this ended up being longer than I originally anticipated (why does that always happen!? =), so I’ll stop here for now, but next time I’ll give some actual Haskell code (which I think ends up being pretty neat!), and talk about one relatively common design pattern which is actually a special case of this monoid.</p>
