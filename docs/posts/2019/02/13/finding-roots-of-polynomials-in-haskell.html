<p>
<strong>tl;dr</strong>: <em>There are several Haskell packages one can use to find an individual root of a function on a certain interval. But I’ve had less luck finding a suitable package for finding all the roots of a given polynomial. This blog post consists of my notes and a plea for help.</em>
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams-solve"><code>diagrams-solve</code> package</a> contains miscellaneous numeric solving routines used in <a href="http://diagrams.github.io">diagrams</a>, including tridiagonal and cyclic tridiagonal linear system solvers (used for generating cubic splines and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams-contrib-1.4.3/docs/Diagrams-TwoD-Path-Metafont.html">emulating Metafont paths</a>) as well as functions for finding roots of low-dimensional polynomials (quadratic, cubic, and quartic). Solving quadratics is used in a bunch of places; solving cubics is needed specifically for doing interior/exterior testing on closed loops built from cubic Bezier curves; thankfully we have never needed to solve a quartic or higher.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the polynomial root solvers are pretty naive: I simply transcribed some formulas (which is why it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem">only goes up to quartics</a>). This works OK a lot of the time, but the formulas are very numerically unstable, and it’s not hard to come up with example inputs where the returned roots are off by quite a bit. In fact, people <a href="https://github.com/diagrams/diagrams-solve/issues/4">regularly run into this</a> when running the test suite. I am not specifically aware of any diagrams bugs that have arisen in actual practice due to the cubic solutions being off, but it’s probably just a matter of time.
</p>
<p>
So I decided it was finally time to look into better root-finding methods. This blog post is both a plea for help and a place to write down some of the things I’ve learned so far.
</p>
<h2 id="theres-root-finding-and-then-theres-root-finding">
There’s root finding, and then there’s root finding
</h2>
<p>
The first thing to get out of the way is that when you talk about “root finding” there are (at least!) two pretty different things you could mean:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
Given a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and some particular interval, or an initial guess, find a value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the interval/close to the initial guess for which <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 0\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Given a polynomial with {real, complex} coefficients, find all its {real, complex} roots.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you want to do (1), there are several nice Haskell packages you could use. The <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/math-functions-0.3.1.0/docs/Numeric-RootFinding.html"><code>Numeric.RootFinding</code> module</a> from the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/math-functions"><code>math-functions</code> package</a> is probably your best bet; it implements both Ridders’ method and the Newton-Raphson method, which both attempt to find a single root of a function on a given interval. They both work on any continuous <code>Double -&gt; Double</code> function, not just polynomials (Newton-Raphson also needs to know the first derivative). But they don’t work well if you don’t already have an interval in mind to search; and if you want to find <em>all</em> the roots you have to call these multiple times (somehow coming up with an appropriate interval each time).
</p>
<p>
As for (2), I haven’t been able to find anything that would work well for <code>diagrams-solve</code>. Here are my notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dsp-0.2.1"><code>dsp</code> package</a> has a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dsp-0.2.1/docs/Polynomial-Roots.html">module <code>Polynomial.Roots</code></a> containing an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguerre%27s_method">Laguerre’s method</a>, which finds all the (complex) roots of a polynomial. However, the <code>dsp</code> package is a rather heavyweight dependency to pull in just for the root-finding code; it’s also licensed under the GPL and I’d like to avoid having to “infect” the entire diagrams ecosystem with the GPL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Laguerre’s method seems like it should be fairly easy to implement myself—<em>but</em> writing my own solver from scratch is how I got here in the first place; I’d really like to avoid it if possible. I am far from being an expert on numerical analysis, floating-point computation, <em>etc.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix-gsl"><code>hmatrix-gsl</code> package</a> has the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix-gsl-0.19.0.1/docs/Numeric-GSL-Polynomials.html"><code>Numeric.GSL.Polynomials</code> module</a>, which has an interface to a root finding algorithm from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html">GSL</a> (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/poly.html#c.gsl_poly_complex_solve">apparently</a> using something called “balanced-QR reduction”), but I’d like to avoid pulling in a C library as as dependency, and also, again, GPL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguerre%27s_method">Wikipedia page for Laguerre’s method</a> I learned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins%E2%80%93Traub_algorithm">Jenkins-Traub algorithm</a> is another widely used method for polynomial root-finding, and often preferred over Laguerre’s method. However, it seems rather complex, and the only Haskell implementation of Jenkins-Traub I have been able to fnid is <a href="https://github.com/frankwang95/jenkins_traub">this one</a> which seems to be just a toy implementation; I don’t even know if it works correctly.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you know of a good place where I can find polynomial solving code in Haskell, can you point me to it? Or if you know more about numerics than me, could you maybe whip up a quick implementation of Laguerre’s method and put it up on Hackage?
</p>
