<section>
<p>
At <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%cf%86">Hac Phi</a> a few weekends ago (which, by the way, was awesome), Dan Doel told me about a certain curiosity in type algebra, and we ended up working out a bunch more details together with Gershom Bazerman, Scott Walck, and probably a couple others I’m forgetting. I decided to write up what we discovered. I have no idea what (if any) of this is really novel, but it was new to me at least.
</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">
The Setup
</h2>
<p>
I’ll assume you’re already familiar with the basic ideas of the <a href="http://blog.lab49.com/archives/3011">algebra of types</a>—<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> represents the void type, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> represents the unit type, sum is tagged union, product is (ordered) pairing, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Given a type <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, since product represents pairing, we can write <span class="math inline">\(T^n\)</span> to represent ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> values. Well, how about <em>unordered</em> <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> values? Since there are <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> possible ways to order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> values, it seems that perhaps we could somehow divide by <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> to "quotient out" by the symmetries we want to disregard: <span class="math inline">\(T^n/n!\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve never seen this sort of thing before it is certainly not at all obvious that this makes any sense! But bear with me for a minute. At the very least, we can say that if this is to make sense we ought to be able to use these sorts of type expressions to calculate the <em>number of inhabitants</em> of a finite type. So, let’s try it. For now let’s take <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> = <code>Bool</code> = <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. I’ll draw the elements of <code>Bool</code> as <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/f4fb3e7eaab3449bd6001af41a0f483e.png" /> and <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bff2a4e3d70aa227274c29acabd24874.png" />.
</p>
<p>
There are clearly four different ordered pairs of <code>Bool</code>:

<p class="caption">
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<span class="math inline">\(T^n\)</span> is supposed to represent ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and indeed, <span class="math inline">\(2^2 = 4\)</span>. How about unordered pairs? Since we don’t care about the order I’ll just choose to canonically sort all the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>s to the front, followed by all the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>s. It’s not hard to see that there are three unordered pairs of <code>Bool</code>:

<p class="caption">
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
(To distinguish them from ordered tuples, I’ll draw unordered tuples as above, with the elements slightly separated and a gray circle drawn round them.)
</p>
<p>
However, when we substitute <span class="math inline">\(T = n = 2\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(T^n/n!\)</span>, we get not <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\((2^2)/2 = 2\)</span>. What gives?
</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">
The problem
</h2>
<p>
The problem is that <span class="math inline">\(T^n/n!\)</span> is only correct if all the values in the tuples are <em>distinct</em>. Then we overcount each unordered tuple by exactly a factor of <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>—namely, all the <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> many permutations of the tuple, each of which is distinct as an ordered tuple. However, when some of the tuples have repeated elements, there can be fewer than <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> distinct ordered variants of a given unordered tuple. For example, the unordered tuple <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/4f56288955edc2f7e4e9bfe64c20bb19.png" /> has only <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (rather than <span class="math inline">\(3! = 6\)</span>) ordered variants, namely

<p class="caption">
</p>

<p>
because the two <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/f4fb3e7eaab3449bd6001af41a0f483e.png" />’s are identical.
</p>
<p>
(As a small aside, when working in the theory of <em>combinatorial species</em> one is concerned not with actual data structures but with data structure <em>shapes</em> full of distinct <em>labels</em>—and the fact that the labels are distinct means that <span class="math inline">\(T^n/n!\)</span> is (in some sense) actually the correct way to talk about unordered tuples within the theory of species. More on this in another post, perhaps.)
</p>
<p>
If <span class="math inline">\(T^n/n!\)</span> is not the correct expression for unordered tuples, what is? In fact, Dan started off this whole thing by telling me the answer to this question—but he didn’t understand <em>why</em> it is the answer; we then proceeded to figure it out. For the purposes of pedagogy I’ll reverse the process, working up from first principles to arrive at the answer.
</p>
<h2 id="counting-unordered-tuples">
Counting unordered tuples
</h2>
<p>
The first order of business is to count unordered tuples. Given a set <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, how many unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples are there with elements drawn from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (where repetition is allowed)? Again, since the order doesn’t matter, we can canonically sort the elements of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with all copies of the first element first, then all copies of the second element, and so on. For example, here is an unordered <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>-tuple with elements drawn from <span class="math inline">\(T = 4 = \{\)</span> <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/8fefeb3ffb94a8ee0d194a608c9d4fbe.png" />, <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1276478a9d4f8202b74c3e8017bdde32.png" />, <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/009204bc277b42931ac22fa76c06dbf3.png" />, <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aaa5b27c0b2deb02de847a7fd8603cfd.png" /> <span class="math inline">\(\}\)</span>:

<p>
Now imagine placing "dividers" to indicate the places where <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/8fefeb3ffb94a8ee0d194a608c9d4fbe.png" /> changes to <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1276478a9d4f8202b74c3e8017bdde32.png" />, <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1276478a9d4f8202b74c3e8017bdde32.png" /> changes to <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/009204bc277b42931ac22fa76c06dbf3.png" />, and so on:

<div style="text-align:center;">

<p class="caption">

<p>
(Note how there are two dividers between the last <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1276478a9d4f8202b74c3e8017bdde32.png" /> and the first <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aaa5b27c0b2deb02de847a7fd8603cfd.png" />, indicating that there are no occurrences of <img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/009204bc277b42931ac22fa76c06dbf3.png" />.) In fact, given that the elements are canonically sorted, it is unnecessary to specify their actual identities:

<p>
So, we can see that unordered <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>-tuples with elements from <span class="math inline">\(T = 4\)</span> correspond bijectively to such arrangements of eight dots and three dividers. In general, unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples are in bijection with arrangements of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dots and <span class="math inline">\(|T|-1\)</span> dividers, and there are as many such arrangements as ways to choose the positions of the <span class="math inline">\(|T|-1\)</span> dividers from among the <span class="math inline">\(n+|T|-1\)</span> total objects, that is,
</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \binom{n+|T|-1}{|T|-1}\)</span></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
(As an aside, this is the same as asking for the number of ways to place <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> indistinguishable balls in <span class="math inline">\(|T|\)</span> distinguishable boxes—the balls in box <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> indicate the multiplicity of element <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple. This is #4 in Gian-Carlo Rota’s "twelvefold way", and is discussed on page 15 of Richard Stanley’s <em>Enumerative Combinatorics</em>, Volume I. See also <a href="http://mathlesstraveled.com/2009/04/14/distributing-cookies-solutions/">this blog post I wrote</a> explaining this and related ideas).
</p>
<h2 id="so-what">
So what?
</h2>
<p>
And now for a little algebra:
</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \begin{array}{cl} &amp; \displaystyle \binom{n+|T|-1}{|T|-1} \\ &amp; \\ = &amp; \displaystyle \frac{(n+|T|-1)!}{n!(|T|-1)!} \\ &amp; \\ = &amp; \displaystyle \frac{(n+|T|-1)(n+|T|-2) \cdots (|T|)}{n!} \\ &amp; \\ = &amp; \displaystyle \frac{|T|(|T|+1)(|T|+2) \cdots (|T| + n-1)}{n!}\end{array}\)</span></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
The expression on top of the fraction is known as a <em>rising factorial</em> and can be abbreviated <span class="math inline">\(|T|^{\overline{n}}\)</span>. (In general, <span class="math inline">\(x^{\overline{n}} = x(x+1)(x+2) \dots (x+n-1)\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(1^{\overline{n}} = n!\)</span>.) In the end, we have discovered that the number of unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(|T|^{\overline{n}}/n!\)</span>, which looks surprisingly similar to the naïve but incorrect <span class="math inline">\(T^n / n!\)</span>. In fact, the similarity is no coincidence, and there are good reasons for using a notation for rising factorial similar to the notation for normal powers, as we shall soon see.
</p>
<p>
And indeed, the correct type expression for unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples of values from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(T^{\overline{n}} / n! = T(T+1)(T+2) \dots (T+(n-1))/n!\)</span>. This means that if we consider the set of ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples where the first element is drawn from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, the second element from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> plus some extra distinguished element, the third from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> plus two extra elements, and so on, there will be exactly <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> of them for every unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple with elements drawn from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. (In fact, we would even expect there to be some nice function from these "extended <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples" to unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples such that the preimage of every unordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple is a set of size exactly <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>—just because combinatorics usually works out like that. Finding such a correspondence is left as an exercise for the reader.)
</p>
<h2 id="a-detour">
A detour
</h2>
<p>
Before we get back to talking about <span class="math inline">\(T^{\overline{n}}/n!\)</span>, a slight detour. Consider the variant type expression <span class="math inline">\(T^{\underline{n}}/n!\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x^{\underline{n}} = x(x-1)(x-2) \dots (x-n+1)\)</span> is a <em>falling factorial</em>. What (if anything) does it represent?
</p>
<p>
Subtraction of types is problematic in general (without resorting to <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2010/11/24/species-subtraction-made-simple.html">virtual species</a>), but in this case we can interpret <span class="math inline">\(T(T-1)(T-2) \dots\)</span> as an ordered <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple with <em>no duplicate values</em>. We can choose any element of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to go first, then any but the first element to go second, then any but the first two, and so on. This can in fact be made rigorous from the perspective of types, without involving virtual species—see <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/09/type-of-distinct-pairs.html">Dan Piponi’s blog post on the subject</a>.

Infinite sums and discrete calculus

<p>
And now for some fun. If we sum <span class="math inline">\(T^{\underline{n}}/n!\)</span> over all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, it ought to represent the type of unordered tuples with distinct values of any length—that is, the type of sets over <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.

</div>
</p>
<p>
Can we find a more compact representation for <span class="math inline">\(S(T)\)</span>?
</p>
<p>
Consider the <em>forward difference</em> operator <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, defined by
</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \Delta f(x) = f(x+1) - f(x)\)</span></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
This is a discrete analogue of the familiar (continuous) differentiation operator from calculus. (For a good introduction to discrete calculus, see Graham <em>et al.</em>’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025"><em>Concrete Mathematics</em></a>, one of my favorite math/CS books ever. See also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">Wikipedia page on finite differences</a>.) For our purposes we simply note that
</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \Delta x^{\underline{n}} = n x^{\underline{n-1}}\)</span></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
(proving this is not hard, and is left as an exercise). This is what justifies the notation for falling factorial: it is in some sense a discrete analogue of exponentiation!
</p>
<p>
The reason to bring <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> into the picture is that given the above identity for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> applied to falling factorials, it is not hard to see that <span class="math inline">\(S(T)\)</span> is its own finite difference:
</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \Delta S(T) = S(T)\)</span></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Expanding, we get <span class="math inline">\(S(T+1) - S(T) = S(T)\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(S(T+1) = 2 S(T)\)</span>. (Yes, I know, there’s that pesky subtraction of types again; in the time-honored tradition of combinatorics we’ll simply pretend it makes sense and trust there is a way to make it more formal!) Solving this recurrence together with the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(S(0) = 1\)</span> yields
</p>
<p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle S(T) = 2^T\)</span></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
which we can interpret as the space of functions from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to <code>Bool</code>—that is, the type of sets over <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, just like it should be! (Note that replacing falling factorial with exponentiation yields something which is its own derivative, with a solution of <span class="math inline">\(e^T\)</span>—which indeed represents the <em>species</em> of sets, though it’s harder to see what <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> has to do with anything.)
</p>
<p>
Enough with the detour. What if we sum over <span class="math inline">\(T^{\overline{n}}/n!\)</span>?
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<div class="figure">

<p>
There’s a <em>backward difference</em> operator, <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(x) = f(x) - f(x-1)\)</span>, with the property that

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \nabla x^{\overline{n}} = n x^{\overline{n-1}}\)</span></p>

<p>
Hence <span class="math inline">\(\nabla M(T) = M(T)\)</span>, <em>i.e.</em> <span class="math inline">\(M(T) - M(T-1) = M(T)\)</span>, but here I am a bit stuck. Trying to solve this in a similar manner as before yields <span class="math inline">\(M(T-1) = 0\)</span>, which seems bogus. <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is certainly not a solution, since <span class="math inline">\(M(0) = 1\)</span>. I think in this case we are actually not justified in subtracting <span class="math inline">\(M(T)\)</span> from both sides, though I’d be hard-pressed to explain exactly why.
</p>

Intuitively, <span class="math inline">\(M(T)\)</span> ought to represent unordered tuples of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of any length—that is, the type of <em>multisets</em> over <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is isomorphic to the space of functions <span class="math inline">\(T \to \mathbb{N}\)</span>, specifying the multiplicity of each element. I claim that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}^T\)</span> is in fact a solution to the above equation—though I don’t really know how to <em>derive</em> it (or even what it really means).

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \begin{array}{cl} &amp; \displaystyle \mathbb{N}^T - \mathbb{N}^{T-1} \\ &amp; \\ \cong &amp; \displaystyle \mathbb{N}^{T-1}(\mathbb{N} - 1) \\ &amp; \\ \cong &amp; \displaystyle \mathbb{N}^{T-1} \mathbb{N} \\ &amp; \\ \cong &amp; \displaystyle \mathbb{N}^T \end{array}\)</span></p>
</div>

The middle step notes that if you take one element away from the natural numbers, you are left with something which is still isomorphic to the natural numbers. I believe the above can all be made perfectly rigorous, but this blog post is already much too long as it is.
