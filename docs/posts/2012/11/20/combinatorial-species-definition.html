Continuing from <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2012/10/27/decomposing-data-structures.html">my previous post</a>, recall that the goal of species is to have a unified theory of <em>containers</em> with <em>labeled<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> locations</em>. So, how do we actually specify such things (leaving aside for the moment the question of how we <em>compute</em> with them)?
</p>
<p>
We might imagine specifying them by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
using any arbitrary set to represent some family of labeled structures (<em>e.g.</em> the set of labeled binary tree structures, the set of labeled list structures, …), together with
</li>
<li>
a function that takes a structure and computes its set of labels.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the face of it this seems quite natural (at least, it does to me). However, it works better to instead use a function <em>from</em> sets of labels to <em>the subset of all structures containing precisely those labels</em>.

In my experience teaching people about species, this often seems to be a source of confusion—it seems “backwards”. More generally, when thinking about a set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> <em>indexed by</em> some other set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (in this case, structures indexed by their sets of labels), one might think to model this by a function <span class="math inline">\(B \to A\)</span> (which tells us the index), but it actually works better to model it by a function <span class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span>, which takes each “index” to the set of all things indexed by it.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Hopefully as we work through the rest of the definition you’ll get a sense for why it works better this way. For now, I think the best advice is <strong>don’t assign computational significance</strong> to these functions from labels to structures. Just think of them as a convenient technical device to keep track of shapes indexed by labels.
</p>
<p>
In any case, the first half of the definition is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A <em>species</em> <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a mapping from sets of labels to sets of structures.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(I deliberately chose the word <em>mapping</em> instead of <em>function</em> to emphasize, again, that we don’t particularly want to assign it computational significance.) Of course, the fact that a species takes sets “of labels” as input and outputs sets “of structures” doesn’t matter; any sets will do, so we might as well just say that a species maps sets to sets. We write <span class="math inline">\(F[U]\)</span> for the species <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> applied to a set of labels <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, and call <span class="math inline">\(F[U]\)</span> the set of “<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-structures with labels drawn from <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>”, or simply “<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-structures on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>”, or even (when <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is clear from context) just “<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-structures”.
</p>
<p>
So far, however, this is rather uninteresting, and moreover it fails to adequately capture our intuition for what “structures” are. Intuitively, the labels are incidental, just like the variable names used in lambda terms are incidental: we must use them to be able to distinguish locations, but the precise objects we use as labels really “shouldn’t matter”. That is, given two sets of labels of the same size, we ought to have “the same” family of structures indexed by each. Of course they can’t be <em>literally</em> the same, because they have different labels! But they should be the same “up to relabeling”. We want to rule out the ability to have two same-size sets of labels indexing wildly different sets of structures: a species shouldn’t be able to “look at” the individual labels in order to “decide” what sort of structures to produce, just like a polymorphic type in Haskell can’t “look at” its type argument. The major difference is that species <em>are</em> allowed to “look at” the <em>size</em> of the label set.
</p>
<p>
Making this intuition precise is the clever part, and is really the pivotal point around which the whole theory revolves. Here’s how we do it. We don’t work with sizes of label sets directly; instead we work with <em>bijections</em> between label sets. (Of course, if there is a bijection between two finite sets then they are necessarily the same size.)
</p>
<p>
Given two label sets <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> which are related by the bijection <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> (sometimes referred to as a <em>relabeling</em>), there must be a relationship between <span class="math inline">\(F[U]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F[V]\)</span>—in particular they must also be in bijection. Here, then, is the second part of the definition:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Given a bijection <span class="math inline">\(\sigma : U \leftrightarrow V\)</span>, a species <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> must also “lift” <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to a bijection <span class="math inline">\(F[\sigma] : F[U] \leftrightarrow F[V]\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Note that we’re recycling notation here, using <span class="math inline">\(F[-]\)</span> for the action of species on both label sets and bijections.) However, this still isn’t quite enough: we don’t want <span class="math inline">\(F[\sigma]\)</span> to be just <em>any</em> bijection between <span class="math inline">\(F[U]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F[V]\)</span>. It really should be the specific bijection that “applies” <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to the labels contained within the structures in <span class="math inline">\(F[U]\)</span>. For example, it would be weird if the identity relabeling, when lifted through <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, resulted in some nontrivial reshuffling of the structures in <span class="math inline">\(F[U]\)</span>. It would also be strange if <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> didn’t respect composition, that is, if there were some <span class="math inline">\(\sigma, \tau\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(F[\sigma] \circ F[\tau] \neq F[\sigma \circ \tau]\)</span>, since intuitively “applying <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> then applying <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>” ought to be the same as “applying <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \circ \tau)\)</span>”. So we add these as conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> must map every identity bijection <span class="math inline">\(id : U \leftrightarrow U\)</span> to the identity <span class="math inline">\(id : F[U] \leftrightarrow F[U]\)</span>, and
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> must preserve composition of bijections, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\forall \sigma, \tau. F[\sigma \circ \tau] = F[\sigma] \circ F[\tau]\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course, all of this may look rather familiar if you know some basic category theory. Consider the category <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{B}\)</span> whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are bijections. Then all of the above can be summed up by the pithy
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>A species is an endofunctor on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{B}\)</span>.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whew! We finally made it to the definition. However, working directly with the definition is not very convenient. In my next post I’ll begin explaining the more usual algebraic approach.
</p>
<p>
At this point I should mention that species were first introduced by André Joyal in his thesis (1981). Unfortunately it is in French, which I cannot read. Fortunately Bergeron, Labelle, and Leroux (1998) wrote an excellent reference text on the subject of species. Unfortunately it is in French too. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~readdy/">Margaret Readdy</a> translated it into English!

A note on spelling: generally, “labeled” is the American spelling and “labelled” British (though “labelled” is also in common American usage, according to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/labeled">Merriam-Webster</a>). I try to consistently use the American spelling, but will probably slip up occasionally, and you should use whichever spelling makes you happiest.<a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a>

I’ve seen this pattern show up multiple times in different category-theoretic contexts, but I don’t feel qualified to comment on it more generally. If you have any pointers to more general discussion of this idea/phenomenon I’d appreciate it.<a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a>
