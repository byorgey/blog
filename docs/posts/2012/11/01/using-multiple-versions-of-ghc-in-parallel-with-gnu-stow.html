Do any of the following apply to you?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You sometimes hack on GHC.
</li>
<li>
You sometimes want to try out an unreleased GHC version.
</li>
<li>
You maintain a library and want to make sure it builds with several different versions of GHC.
</li>
<li>
You want to try out a newly released version of GHC but without blowing away your existing (working!) GHC install.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you can see, these are roughly in order from most to least “hard core”, and I expect that the last two are fairly common, even if the first two are not. The common thread, of course, is <strong>having multiple versions of GHC installed simultaneously</strong>.
</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">
The solution
</h2>
<p>
A solution that I’ve found which works quite well (on Linux, and I expect it would work on OSX as well) and deserves to be better known is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU stow</a>. Here’s how it works: instead of installing things directly in <code>/usr/local</code> (or <code>$HOME/local</code>, or whatever), you instead install in sandboxed locations like <code>/usr/local/stow/ghc-7.6.1</code>. You then tell <code>stow</code> that you want to “install” <code>ghc-7.6.1</code>, and it creates all the necessary symlinks to mirror the directory structure under the <code>ghc-7.6.1</code> directory into <code>/usr/local</code>. But of course it tracks everything so that you can easily <em>uninstall</em> all these symlinks as well. (And yes, it’s smart about symlinking an entire directory when possible, instead of all the individual files, and later “splitting up” such big-scale links when necessary.)
</p>
<p>
The pros of this sort of scheme should be clear:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>
Once you’ve “installed” a particular version you just use it as normal—no need to pass the right directories as flags to tools like <code>cabal</code> or <code>ghc-pkg</code>.
</li>
<li>
Switching to a different version of GHC is relatively quick (see below).
</li>
<li>
Installing new versions is pain-free; it’s just as easy to have twenty different versions as it is to have two.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Of course, there are a few downsides as well:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>
Trusting a Perl script to munge your <code>/usr/local</code>. (Though for what it’s worth, I have been using it heavily for about a year now—I currently have six different versions of GHC installed—and have never once encountered a single problem.)<br />
</li>
<li>
You can’t use several versions of GHC <em>at once</em>—there is always exactly one “current” version. So if you want to, <em>e.g.</em>, do test builds of a library under several versions of GHC in parallel, you need a different solution.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-step-by-step-guide">
A step-by-step guide
</h2>
<p>
So here’s how this works in more detail. First, of course, you have to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">install stow itself</a>; I’ll assume you can get it from your OS package manager or know how to build it from source. What you get is simply an executable called <code>stow</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now, when installing GHC (whether a binary distribution or from source), give the <code>configure</code> step an extra <code>prefix</code> argument, for example:
</p>
<p>
<code>./configure –prefix=/usr/local/stow/ghc-7.6.1</code>
</p>
<p>
Just take the directory where you would usually install GHC, and add <code>stow</code> and then an additional subdirectory for the particular version you are installing. This directory doesn’t have to already exist; the installer will create it if it doesn’t.
</p>
<p>
(Note that if you already have GHC installed, you’ll have to uninstall it first and then reinstall it with <code>stow</code>—<code>stow</code> won’t work unless it can manage <em>all</em> your GHC installs.)
</p>
<p>
After the installation process completes, you have an unusable <code>ghc</code> because, of course, <code>…/stow/ghc-7.6.1</code> isn’t on any relevant paths. All you have to do to finish installing it is
</p>
<p>
<code>cd /usr/local/stow &amp;&amp; stow ghc-7.6.1</code>
</p>
<p>
This instructs <code>stow</code> to make symlinks into <code>ghc-7.6.1</code> from <code>/usr/local</code>. After this completes, that’s it! You can use your new GHC as usual.
</p>
<p>
To <em>uninstall</em>, follow the same procedure but give <code>stow</code> the <code>-D</code> option:
</p>
<p>
<code>cd /usr/local/stow &amp;&amp; stow -D ghc-7.6.1</code>
</p>
<p>
To <em>switch</em> from one version of GHC to another just uninstall the current version and then install the new one. I actually have a <a href="http://hub.darcs.net/byorgey/brent/browse/Main.hs#109">script which automates this process</a>: it looks in the <code>stow</code> directory to see which versions are availble, prompts me to choose one from a list, then uninstalls the current version (obtained with <code>ghc –numeric-version</code>) and installs the newly selected version. On my laptop this process takes just a couple seconds.
</p>
<p>
That’s it! Happy stowing!
