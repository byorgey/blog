<section>
<p>In January 2009, while just a baby first-year PhD student, I wrote a
blog post titled <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy.html">Abstraction, intuition, and the “monad tutorial
fallacy”</a>.
In it, I made the argument that humans tend to learn best by first
grappling with concrete examples, and only later proceeding to
higher-level intuition and analogies; hence, it’s a mistake to
think that clearly presenting your intuition for a topic will help
other people understand it. Analogies and intuition can help, but
only when accompanied by concrete examples and active engagement. To
illustrate the point, I made up a fictitious programmer with a
fictitious analogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But now Joe goes and writes a monad tutorial called “Monads are
Burritos,” under the well-intentioned but mistaken assumption that
if other people read his magical insight, learning about monads will
be a snap for them. “Monads are easy,” Joe writes. “Think of them as
burritos.” Joe hides all the actual details about types and such
because those are scary, and people will learn better if they can
avoid all that difficult and confusing stuff. Of course, exactly
the opposite is true, and all Joe has done is make it <em>harder</em> for
people to learn about monads…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My intention was to choose a fictitious analogy which was obviously
ridiculous and silly, as a parody of many of the monad tutorials which
existed at the time (and still do). <a href="https://blog.plover.com/meta/about-me.html">Mark Jason Dominus</a>
then wrote a blog post, <a href="https://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html">Monads are like
burritos</a>, pointing out
that actually, monads <em>are</em> kinda like burritos. It’s really funny,
though I don’t think it’s actually a very good analogy, and my guess
is that Mark would agree: it was clearly written as a silly joke and
not as a real way to explain monads.</p>
<p>In any case, from that point the “monads are burritos” meme took on a
life of its own. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/monads-are-burritos/">Chris Done made a webcomic about
it</a></li>
<li><a href="https://edwardmorehouse.github.io/silliness/burrito_monads.pdf">Ed Morehouse wrote a ridiculous paper exploring the categorical
foundations of burritos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/withoutboats/burrito">Someone made a <code>burrito</code> library in Rust</a></li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/DrEugeniaCheng/status/1316817271961116679">Dr Eugenia Cheng tweeted about it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I even joined in the fun and made this meme image about bad monad
tutorials:</p>
<p><img src="images/monad_tutorial.jpg" /></p>
<p>Of course there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/6bxk1v/why_monads_always_get_compared_to_burritos/">lots of people who still understand that it was all just a silly joke</a>.
Recently, however, I’ve seen several instances where people apparently
believe “monads are burritos” is a real, helpful thing and not just a
joke meme. For example, see <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/xmpj1p/you_probably_wrote_half_monad_by_accident">this thread on
lobste.rs</a>,
or <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@CubeRootOfTrue/114404282908533701">this Mastodon post</a>.</p>
<p>So, to set the record straight: “monads are burritos” is <em>not</em> a helpful
analogy!<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Yes, I am writing a blog post because <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">People Are Wrong On
The Internet</a>, and I know it probably won’t
make any difference, but here we are.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Why not, you ask?
To expand on my reasons from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3bdrlj/comment/ct24jmc/">10-year-old Reddit
comment</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The burrito analogy strongly implies that a value of type <code>m a</code>
somehow “contains” a value (or values) of type <code>a</code>. But that is not
true for all monads (e.g. there is no sense in which a value of type
<code>IO String</code> contains a <code>String</code>).</li>
<li>Relatedly, the analogy also implies that a value of type <code>m a</code> can
be “unwrapped” to get an <code>a</code>, but this is impossible for many monads.</li>
<li>It is not actually very easy to take a burrito containing a burrito
and merge it into a single-level burrito. At least this is not in
any sense a natural operation on burritos. Perhaps you could argue
that it is always easy to remove outer tortilla layers (but not the
innermost one since the food will all fall out), but this is a bad
analogy, since in general <code>join</code> does not just “remove” an outer
layer, but somehow merges the effects of two layers into one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, burritos are a great analogy for the <code>Identity</code> monad!
…but not much beyond that.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, my sense is that the average
pedagogical quality of Haskell materials, and monad tutorials in
particular, has indeed gone up significantly since 2009. I’d love to
think this can be at least partially attributed to my original blog
post, though of course it’s impossible to know that for sure.</p>
