<p>I’m the general chair this year for the <a href="http://functional-art.org/2018/">ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design</a> (better known as FARM), which will be colocated with ICFP this September in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. The goal of the workshop is to “gather together people who are harnessing functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression”. For me (and I think for many others as well), FARM, including the associated performance evening, is always one of the highlights of ICFP.</p>
<p>Please consider submitting something! As in previous years, we are accepting a wide range of types of submissions. Paper and demo submissions are due by June 28: you can submit original research, a technology tutorial, a call for collaboration, or propose some sort of live demo. In addition, we also solicit performances to be given during the associated performance evening—performance proposals are due by July 8.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://functional-art.org/2018/">the website for more info</a>, and let me know if you have any questions!</p>
