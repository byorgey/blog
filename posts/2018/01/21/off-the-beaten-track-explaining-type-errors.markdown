<p>Last week I gave a talk at <a href="https://popl18.sigplan.org/track/OBT-2018">Off the Beaten Track 2018</a> about something that <a href="https://cs.brynmawr.edu/~rae/">Richard Eisenberg</a>, <a href="http://metatheorem.org/">Harley Eades</a> and I have been thinking about recently: namely, how to generate good interactive <em>error explanations</em> for programmers, especially for type errors. None of the talks at OBT were recorded, but Iâ€™ve prepared a <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/pub/explaining-errors-slides.pdf">version of my slides interspersed with (something like) a transcript of what I said</a>.</p>
