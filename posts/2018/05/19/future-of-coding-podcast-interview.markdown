<p>I recently did an interview with my friend and former student <a href="http://stevekrouse.com/">Steve Krouse</a> for his <a href="http://futureofcoding.org/episodes/23">Future of Coding podcast</a>. I think I still agree with almost everything I said, and I didn’t say anything too embarrassing, so if you want to listen to it I won’t stop you! We chatted about teaching and learning, functional programming and type systems, how to read academic papers, and a bunch of other things. You can <a href="http://futureofcoding.org/episodes/23">listen to it here</a>.</p>
