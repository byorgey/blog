<p>I do not know many details, but IRC user <code>mupf</code> joined the <code>#haskell-ops</code> channel yesterday to tell us that <a href="http://ertes.eu/about.html">Ertugrul Söylemez</a> died unexpectedly on May 12. This is a great loss for the Haskell community. Going variously by <code>mm_freak</code>, <code>ertes</code>, <code>ertesx</code> or <code>ertes-w</code>, Ertugrul has been very active on the <code>#haskell</code> IRC channel for almost 11 years—since June 2007—and he will be remembered as a knowledgeable, generous, and patient teacher. In addition to teaching on IRC, he wrote several tutorials, such as <a href="http://ertes.eu/tutorial/foldr.html">this one on foldr</a> and <a href="http://ertes.eu/tutorial/monoids.html">this one on monoids</a>. The thing Ertugrul was probably most well-known for in the Haskell community was his <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netwire">netwire</a> FRP package, which he had developed since 2011, and more recently its successor package <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wires">wires</a>. I think it is no exaggeration to say that his work on and insights into FRP helped shape a whole generation of approaches.</p>
<p>He will be greatly missed. I will leave the comments open for anyone to share memories of Ertugrul, his writing, or his code.</p>
