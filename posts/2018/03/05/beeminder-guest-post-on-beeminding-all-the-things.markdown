<p>I’ve written about my use of <a href="http://beeminder.com">Beeminder</a> a <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2013/04/16/beeminding-for-fun-and-profit.html">few</a> <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2016/05/17/in-praise-of-beeminder.html">times</a> here before. I just wrote a <a href="https://blog.beeminder.com/allthethings/">guest post for the Beeminder blog</a> entitled <em>Beeminding All The Things</em>, in which I explain some lessons learned and best practices for dealing with a very large number of Beeminder goals (50, in my case)—and why you might even consider having so many in the first place. If thinking about tools for productivity is your cup of tea, you might be interested to check it out.</p>
