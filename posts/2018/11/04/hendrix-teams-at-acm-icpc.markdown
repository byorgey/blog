<p>Today I took five students from Hendrix to Fort Smith to compete in the Mid-Central USA Regional of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Both teams solved five out of ten problems, and <a href="https://mcpc18.kattis.com/standings?filter=1809">finished second and fourth out of 18 teams at our site</a> (23rd and 25th out of 121 teams in the whole region). Iâ€™m really proud of them!</p>

<p>A lot of fun was had by all. Thanks to Andrew Mackey and the rest of the folks at UAFS for hosting a great contest!</p>
