<p>Kenny Foner and I have <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/pub/GCBP-author-version.pdf">a paper</a> accepted to ICFP on <em>subtracting bijections</em>. Hereâ€™s the basic problem: suppose you have a bijection $latex h$ between two sum types, $latex h : A + B \leftrightarrow A' +B'$, and another bijection $latex g : B \leftrightarrow B'$. Of course $latex A$ and $latex A'$ must have the same size, but can you construct an actual bijection $latex f$ between $latex A$ and $latex A'$?</p>

<p>This problem and its solution has been well-studied in the context of combinatorics; we were wondering what additional insight could be gained from a higher-level functional approach. You can <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/pub/GCBP-author-version.pdf">get a preprint here</a>.</p>
