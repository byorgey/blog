<p>My <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/mathcs/">department</a> at <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/">Hendrix College</a> is <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/humanresources/page.aspx?id=73620&amp;gnk=job&amp;gni=8a7885a8612bf7ec01616baea0a66632&amp;gns=Professional%20Organization%20Job%20Boards%2FEmail">hiring a 1-year visitor in CS for next year</a>. This is my third year at Hendrix and I really love it—the department is friendly and supportive, the administration really cares about faculty and students, and the students, on the whole, are motivated, bright, and enthusiastic. The position is a sabbatical replacement, so there’s no possibility of it turning into something longer than a year; nonetheless, it is a great opportunity for someone interested in pursuing a position at a liberal arts institution who wants to gain more teaching experience (something that is an absolute must for a liberal arts job but can be hard to come by in grad school). I think my department does a great job of supporting one another and helping each other grow as teachers, so it wouldn’t just be something to put on your CV, but a real opportunity to become a better teacher. And Conway, Arkansas is a wonderful place to live—despite what certain prejudices may lead you to believe!</p>
<p>The initial application deadline is soon (February 28)—I forgot to post something about it earlier!—but we’ll continue to accept applications until the position is filled, so don’t hesitate to apply even if you end up missing the deadline by a bit. And of course feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
