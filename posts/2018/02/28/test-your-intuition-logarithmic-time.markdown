<p>Here is a question to test your intuition for logarithms. <strong>NO CALCULATORS</strong> allowed, and don’t take a long time to work out an answer in your head! Just go with your gut. After you have committed to a choice (say, by writing it down), then go get a calculator and a pencil and see if you can work out whether you were right!</p>
<p><em>On a certain input, an $O(n)$ algorithm runs in one-tenth of a second. On the same input, an $O(n^2)$ algorithm takes one and a half weeks to run. Approximately how long would an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm take on the same input?</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li><em>a few seconds?</em></li>
<li><em>a few minutes?</em></li>
<li><em>a few hours?</em></li>
<li><em>a few days?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m pretty sure it wasn’t until quite a few years out of undergrad that I would have gotten this right.</p>
