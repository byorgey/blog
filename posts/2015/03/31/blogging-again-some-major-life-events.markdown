It's been a <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/maniac-week-postmortem/">long time</a> since I've written anything here; the blog was on hold while I was finishing my PhD and on the academic job market. Now that things have settled down a bit I plan to <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/goals/blog">get back to blogging</a>.

For starters, here are a few of the major events that have happened in the meantime, that readers of this blog might care about:

<ul>
	<li>I successfully defended my <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/hosted/thesis.pdf">PhD dissertation</a> in October, officially graduated in December, and got an actual diploma in the mail a few weeks ago.  I'll be back in Philadelphia for the official graduation ceremony in May.</li>
	<li>I accepted a tenure-track position at <a href="http://hendrix.edu">Hendrix College</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway,_Arkansas">Conway, Arkansas</a>, and will be moving there this summer.</li>
	<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/+DanPiponi">Dan Piponi</a> and I had a paper accepted to <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/MPC2015/">MPC 2015</a>. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/type-matrices/">github repo</a>, and I plan to post a PDF copy here soon (once I get around to incorporating feedback from the reviewers).  I look forward to seeing a bunch of folks (Volk?) in KÃ¶nigswinter this summer; I already have my plane tickets (CIU -&gt; DTW -&gt; AMS -&gt; CGN, it's a long story).</li>
	<li>Work on <a href="http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/">diagrams</a> continues strong (no thanks to me!), and we are aiming for a big new release soon---I will certainly post about that here as well.</li>
</ul>
