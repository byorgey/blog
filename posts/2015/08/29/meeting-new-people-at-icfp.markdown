This afternoon I'll be getting on a plane to Vancouver for <a href="http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/">ICFP</a>.  I'm looking forward to seeing many friends, of course, but I also enjoy meeting new people---whether or not they are "famous", whether or not I think they can "advance my career".  So I'll just throw this out there: if you will be in Vancouver this week and would like to meet me, just leave a comment and I will make a point of trying to find you to chat!  I'll be attending the Haskell Implementor's Workshop, the Ally Skills Tutorial, ICFP itself, the Haskell Symposium, and FARM, but there's also plenty of time to chat in the hallway or over a meal.
