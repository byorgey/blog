<p>About a year and a half ago <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/catsters-guide/">I announced</a> that I had started creating a guide to the excellent series of category theory YouTube videos by <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/The+Catsters">the Catsters</a> (aka <a href="http://www.cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Eugenia Cheng</a> and <a href="http://www.simonwillerton.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Simon Willerton</a>). I am happy to report that as of today, the <a href="http://byorgey.wordpress.com/catsters-guide-2/">guide is finally complete</a>!</p>
<p>As far as possible, I have tried to arrange the order so that each video only depends on concepts from earlier ones. (If you have any suggestions for improving the ordering, I would love to hear them!) Along with each video you can also find my cryptic notes; I make no guarantee that they will be useful to anyone (even me!), but hopefully they will at least give you an idea of what is in each video.</p>
<p>If and when they post any new videos (pretty please?) I will try to keep it updated.</p>
