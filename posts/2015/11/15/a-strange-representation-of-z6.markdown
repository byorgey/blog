<p>On my <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.wordpress.com/">other blog</a> I am writing about a proof of the Lucas-Lehmer test, and today in the course of working up some examples I stumbled across this little gem.</p>
<p>Let $latex M$ be a monoid, and let $latex M^*$ denote the subset of elements of $latex M$ which actually have an inverse. Then it is not hard to show that $latex M^*$ is a group: the identity is its own inverse and hence is in $latex M^*$; it is closed under the monoid operation since if $latex a$ and $latex b$ have inverses then so does $latex ab$ (namely, $latex b^{-1}a^{-1}$); and clearly the inverse of every element in $latex M^*$ is also in $latex M^*$, because <em>being</em> an inverse also implies <em>having</em> one.</p>
<p>Now let $latex M = \{a + b\sqrt{3} \mid 0 \leq a,b &lt; 3\}$, where the operation is multiplication, but the coefficients $latex a$ and $latex b$ are reduced modulo 3. For example, $latex (2 + \sqrt 3)(2 + 2 \sqrt 3) = (4 + 6) + (4 + 2) \sqrt 3 = 1 + 0 \sqrt 3$. This does turn out to be associative, and is clearly commutative; and $latex 1 = 1 + 0\sqrt 3$ is the identity. I wrote a little program to see which elements have inverses, and it turns out that the three elements with $latex a = 0$ do not, but the other six do. So this is an Abelian group of order 6; but thereâ€™s only one such group, namely, the cyclic group $latex \mathbb{Z}_6$. And, sure enough, $latex M^*$ turns out to be generated by $latex 2 + \sqrt 3$ and $latex 2 + 2 \sqrt 3$.</p>
