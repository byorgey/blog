I just <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xn9TB3cIguwav3SNLObHqOJfgRej9jg2OLOjTByhWeE/viewform">signed up</a> for the <a href="http://catamorphism.org/Ally2015/">Ally Skills Tutorial</a> at ICFP, and if you are (1) a man who (2) will be at <a href="http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/">ICFP</a> in Vancouver, I encourage you to sign up, too!  From the website:

<blockquote>
The Ally Skills Tutorial teaches men simple, everyday ways to support women in their workplaces and communities. Participants learn techniques that work at the office, in classrooms, at conferences, and online. The skills we teach are relevant everywhere, including skills particularly relevant to open technology and culture communities. At the end of the tutorial, participants will feel more confident in speaking up to support women, be more aware of the challenges facing women in their workplaces and communities, and have closer relationships with the other participants. 
</blockquote>

This sounds super helpful---I suspect there is often a large gap between the extent to which I <i>want</i> to support women and the extent to which I actually know, practically, how to do so.  The workshop will be taught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Aurora">Valerie Aurora</a>, Linux filesystem developer and <a href="https://adainitiative.org/">Ada Initiative</a> co-founder; I expect it will be high quality!
