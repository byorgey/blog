My wife and I have now completed our move to Philadelphia!  Nothing much to report, really -- the move went very smoothly with a lot of great help from friends, and we're slowly digging our way out from under all the boxes and getting settled.  The reason for the move, as you may or may not know, is that I'll be starting a PhD in programming languages at U Penn.  Classes start in a month, and I don't think I've been this excited to go back to school since my first day of junior high school -- I've been out of undergrad four years now!  I do hope to get on campus earlier than the start of classes, hopefully sometime later this week, to begin getting involved in stuff and get my bearings a bit.
