Woohoo!  I'm headed to Portland in a few weeks to visit PSU -- arriving on the evening of Thursday Feb. 14 and heading back on the morning of Sunday the 17th.  So I'll have two whole days in which to visit PSU, see the (by all accounts beautiful) city of Portland, and hopefully -- which is the main reason for this blog post -- squeeze in a chance to meet some cool Portlandites.  If you're reading this and you live in Portland, chances are that you count. =)  Drop me a comment if you'd be interested in meeting up and hopefully we can work something out!

I'm also looking for a place to stay while I'm there -- nothing fancy required, just a place to crash.  If anyone would be willing and able to put me up for those three nights, I'd be immensely grateful.  I could stay in a hotel, of course, but staying with someone would be a lot more fun, and a better opportunity to meet people.
