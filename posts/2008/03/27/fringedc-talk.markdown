My FringeDC talk has now been uploaded to Google video!  A huge thanks to Conrad Barski, who took the effort to actually record the video and then wrangle it into digital form.  Without further ado:

The <a href='http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/xmonad.pdf' title='FringeDC slides'>slides are here</a> if you'd like to follow along.

In general I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.  This is one of the first "real" talks I've given, though (although I did teach high school for two years), so I definitely learned a lot and have some good ideas for improving the next talk I give. 

Comments or questions welcome!

<b>ETA</b>: the Java bug mentioned in the video was just fixed today!  w00t!
