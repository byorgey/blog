I've just accepted an offer of admission to the PhD program in computer science at U Penn!  In particular I'll be working with the PL group.  I'm super-excited -- especially since I've now been out in the "real world" for four years.  Not that I was particularly burned out at the end of undergrad, but I didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do.  Well, now I know: I want to go back to school!  September is still a long way off... but oh well, I'll deal. =)  Now to find a job for Joyia, and a church, and a place to live...
