I'm posting this appeal here, in case anyone who reads it is planning to attend <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2008/03/15/fringedc-formal-meeting-march-22.html">my talk on Saturday</a> but isn't subscribed to the FringeDC mailing list.  I'd really love for my talk to be recorded on video, but so far no one has volunteered.  Might you be that generous person...? =)
