<p>Continuing the <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2023/05/31/competitive-programming-in-haskell-introduction-to-dynamic-programming.html">series on dynamic programming</a>, I just have a couple challenge problems for you today. I have indeed solved both of these problems in Haskell, but I don’t yet know how to write <strong>elegant</strong> solutions! There is a reason that the techniques covered in my <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2023/06/06/dynamic-programming-in-haskell-automatic-memoization.html">previous posts</a> aren’t quite good enough.</p>

</ul>
<p>Feel free to discuss in the comments! I’m hoping that I can learn some new approaches from some of my readers. I will probably post some hints in the comments towards the right recurrences, so don’t look at the comments if you don’t want any spoilers.</p>
