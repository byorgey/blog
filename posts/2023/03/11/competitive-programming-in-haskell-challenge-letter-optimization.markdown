<p>Now that I’ve wrapped up my series of posts on <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/infinite2darray">Infinite 2D Array</a> (<a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2022/09/01/competitive-programming-in-haskell-infinite-2d-array.html">challenge</a>, <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2022/12/03/competitive-programming-in-haskell-infinite-2d-array-level-1.html">part 1</a>, <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2023/01/16/competitive-programming-in-haskell-infinite-2d-array-levels-2-and-3.html">part 2</a>, <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2023/02/24/competitive-programming-in-haskell-infinite-2d-array-level-4.html">part 3</a>), I’d like to tackle another topic related to competitive programming in Haskell. I won’t tell you what the topic is quite yet—for now, I challenge you to use Haskell to solve <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/brevoptimering">Letter Optimiztion</a>! Feel free to post thoughts, questions, solutions, etc. in the comments (so don’t look at the comments if you don’t want spoilers!). In an upcoming post I will discuss my solution.</p>
