<p>I’m in Memphis (again!) this weekend attending the 2016 <a href="http://www.ccsc-ms.org/">CCSC Midsouth Regional Conference</a>, which also has a student programming contest attached. I’m very proud of the two teams from Hendrix, who <a href="http://www.ccsc-ms.org/index.php?page=contest&amp;sub=results">placed first and fifth</a> out of 17 teams. This is now the third year in a row that a team from Hendrix has won the contest (though I had nothing to do with the first two!). The members of the winning team are all graduating this year, but each of the members of the other team will be around at least one more year, and I have talked to quite a few other students who are interested. I’m excited to continue building up a programming team with a tradition of excellence.</p>
