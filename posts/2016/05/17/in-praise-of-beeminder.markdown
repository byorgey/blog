<p>In <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/beeminding-for-fun-and-profit/">January 2013, I wrote a post</a> explaining my use of <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a>, after using it for six months. Well, I’ve now been using it continuously for almost four years! It has become such an integral part of my life and workflow that I literally don’t know what I would do if it went away. So I decided it was high time to write another blog post about Beeminder. This time, instead of enumerating <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey">things I am currently using it for</a>, I will focus on <em>things I have accomplished</em> with the help of Beeminder. There is little doubt in my mind that I am much awesomer today than I would have been without Beeminder.</p>

<p>First, what is Beeminder? Here’s what I wrote three and a half years ago, which I think is still a good description:</p>
<blockquote>
The basic idea is that it helps you keep track of progress on any quantifiable goals, and gives you short-term incentive to stay on track: if you don’t, Beeminder takes your money. But it’s not just about the fear of losing money. Shiny graphs tracking your progress coupled with helpfully concrete short-term goals (“today you need to write 1.3 pages of that paper”) make for excellent positive motivation, too.
</blockquote>
<p>The key property that makes Beeminder work so well for me is that it <em>makes long-term goals into short-term ones</em>. I am a terrible procrastinator—due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting">hyperbolic discounting</a> I can be counted on to pretty much ignore anything with long-term rewards or consequences. A vague sense that I ought to take better care of my bike is not enough to compel me to action in the present; but “<em>inflate your tires and grease your chain before midnight or else pay $5</em>” is.</p>
<p>So, what have I accomplished over the past three years?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the big one: I finished my PhD! A PhD dissertation is much too big to put off until the last minute. <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/thesis-proposal">Writing my thesis proposal</a>, <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/thesis">researching</a> and <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/pages">writing</a> my dissertation itself, and <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/defense">making slides for my defense</a> were all largely driven by Beeminder goals. I am honestly not sure if I would have been able to finish otherwise.</li>
<li>I landed two jobs: first, a one-year position at <a href="http://www.cs.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>, and now a tenure-track position at <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/">Hendrix College</a>. Preparing application materials and applying for academic jobs is not much fun, and it was a really tough slog putting everything together, especially while I was teaching at Williams last year. Having a <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/application">Beeminder goal for spending time on my application materials</a> was absolutely critical.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/catsters">finished watching</a> every single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters">Catsters video</a> and writing up a <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/catsters-guide-2/">toplogically sorted guide to the series</a>.</li>
<li>Since March 2015, when I started cranking up <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/blog">my Beeminder goal for writing blog posts</a> again, I have written over 80 posts on my <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/">two</a> <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/">blogs</a>. I also wrote more than 40 posts in late 2012-early 2013 using <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/blogging">another goal</a> (the gap from 2013-2015 was when I was writing my dissertation instead of blogging!).</li>
<li>Over the past three years, I have spent about 1 hour per week (typically spread over 3 or 4 days) learning biblical Hebrew. It adds up to almost 150 hours of Hebrew study—which doesn’t sound like a whole lot, but almost every minute of it was quality, focused study time. And since it has been so spread out, the material is quite firmly embedded in my long-term memory. I recently finished working through the entire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basics-Biblical-Hebrew-Grammar-Second/dp/0310270200">introductory textbook</a> I was using, while doing every single exercise in the associated workbook. I am still far from being an expert, but I can actually read simple things now.</li>
<li>Over the past 6 months I <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/weight">lost more than 15 pounds</a>.</li>
<li>Since September I have been <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/swim">swimming two mornings a week</a>: when I started, I could barely do two laps before feeling like I was going to be sick; now, I can swim 500m in under 9 minutes (just under double world record pace =).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of other things I use Beeminder for, but these are the accomplishments I am proudest of. If you want to do awesome things but can never quite seem to find the time or motivation to do them, <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/overview">give it a try</a>!</p>
