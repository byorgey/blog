<p>I have finally finished up writing my guide on <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/">how to print things</a>, based on <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">this blog post from January</a> on my <a href="http://mathlesstraveled.com">other (math) blog</a>. It specifically enumerates the pros and cons of various methods for <strong>printing and reading loose-leaf documents</strong> (the sort of thing that academics do quite a bit, when they print out a journal article to read).</p>
<p>The main motivation for writing the page is to explain the (to my knowledge, novel) <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided"><strong>Möbius method</strong></a> for printing and reading double-sided, like this:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="http://byorgey.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/5887ee20fb9bd0ae.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>I actually now use this in practice. As compared to the usual method of printing double-sided, this has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>One always does the exact same action after finishing every page; there is no need to remember whether you are on an even or an odd page.</li>
<li>Any consecutive sequence of $n/2$ pages are on different sheets of paper, so it is easy to simultaneously refer to multiple pages close together. There is never any need to keep flipping a sheet back and forth to refer to the previous page (as there is with traditional double-sided printing).</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are even new things to say about traditional double-sided printing, as well. I now know of several different algorithms for reading double-sided, each with its pros and cons; previously I had not even considered that there might be more than one way to do it.</p>
