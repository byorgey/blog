<p><a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/pub/twisted.pdf">How to Twist Pointers without Breaking Them</a></p>
<p>Although pointer manipulations are used as a primary motivating example, at heart the paper is really about “twisted functors”, a class of applicative functors which arise as a natural generalization of the semi-direct product of two monoids where one acts on the other. It’s a really cute idea<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, one of those ideas which seems “obvious” in retrospect, but really hadn’t been explored before.</p>
<p>We give some examples of applications in the paper but I’m quite certain there are many other examples of applications out there. If you find any, let us know!</p>
