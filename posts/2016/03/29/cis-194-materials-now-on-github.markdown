<p>I’ve been meaning for a while to put the source files for my CIS 194 materials in a publically accessible place, and I’ve finally gotten around to it: you can now find everything in <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/haskell-course">byorgey/haskell-course</a> on github.</p>
<p>I make no particular guarantees about anything; <em>e.g.</em> there is a crufty, complicated <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake">shake</a> script that builds everything, but it probably doesn’t even compile with the latest version of Shake.</p>
<p>There are some obvious next steps, for which I have not the time:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Get everything building again</li>
<li>Fix any outstanding typos, confusions, etc.</li>
<li>Update it to be more specifically for general-audience learning rather than for a course at Penn</li>
<li>Find a permanent web home for the material. It’s sort of a happy accident that it has been accessible on the Penn site for so long, but it’s not a stable situation; I don’t even know who would have access to that site anymore.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the material is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, so go wild using it however you like, or working on the above next steps. Pull requests are very welcome, and I will likely give out commit access like candy.</p>
