<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86">Hac Phi</a> is coming up in less than a month, August 3-5 here in Philadelphia: three days of hanging out with awesome people, eating good food, and hacking on Haskell projects.  Judging by past instances, I promise you it will be super fun, whether you just started programming in Haskell yesterday or have been for twenty years.

In case you need some extra encouragement and the <a href="http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams">diagrams</a> project sounds interesting to you, let me explicitly state that <i>if you attend Hac Phi and want to help with the diagrams project, I will personally sit down with you</i> at least once, more likely multiple times, over the course of the weekend and walk through code with you, do some pair programming, whatever is appropriate to get you to the next level of productivity with diagrams and/or Haskell.  This applies no matter how much experience you have with diagrams or with Haskell---from absolutely none to quite a lot.

In fact, I would be perfectly happy to spend the entire weekend mentoring others and writing not a single line of code myself.  Over the years I have learned that when it comes to a big project like diagrams, fostering collaboration is actually the most important aspect of a hackathon, rather than getting a bunch of coding done myself---I can always go pound out code at home once everyone has left.

So, if that sounds like fun to you, be sure to <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86/Register">register</a> (registration closes in a little under two weeks), and let me know you're coming.  I'm also happy to discuss concrete ideas for diagrams-related projects.
