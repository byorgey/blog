<p>As of this writing, I am the <em>only</em> person who has solved <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/origami">Origami</a> on Open Kattis (see the <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/origami/statistics">problem statistics here</a>). This is a shame since it is a very nice problem! Of course, I solved it in Haskell.</p>
<p>I challenge you to solve itâ€”bonus points for using a <em>fold</em> in your solution!</p>
