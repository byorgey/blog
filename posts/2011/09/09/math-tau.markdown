I have just uploaded <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tau" title="The tau package">a new package</a> to Hackage which defines the <a href="http://tauday.com">constant $\tau$</a>.  Now if you wish to use $\tau$ in your program you can just <code>cabal install tau</code> and then <code>import Math.Tau (tau)</code>, and be assured that you are using only the highest-quality definition of this fundamentally important constant.
