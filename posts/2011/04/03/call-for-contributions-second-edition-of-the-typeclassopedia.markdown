The <a href="http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf">Typeclassopedia</a>, by all accounts, has turned out to be a popular and useful resource for Haskell programmers.  I've been thinking for a while about putting out a revised and expanded second edition, and it's finally time.  Planned changes include:
<ul>
	<li>making suggested exercises stand out typographically and adding many more;</li>
	<li>updating information about various standard packages (mtl, transformers, etc.) to match the current state of affairs;</li>
	<li>switching away from Pointed as a stepping stone to Applicative in favor of a more <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroupoids">semigroupoid</a>-based approach;</li>
	<li>expanding the sections on comonads and arrows, which were a bit rushed in the first edition;</li>
	<li>many other small additions, clarifications, and corrections.</li>
</ul>

However, the first edition was immeasurably improved by suggestions and contributions from many readers, and I hope the same will be true for the second.  So, what would you like to see in the second edition?  Some prompts to help you think of ways to contribute:
<ul>
	<li>Is there a section you find confusing?  Do you have a suggestion to improve its clarity?</li>
	<li>Do you have a suggestion for a good exercise?</li>
	<li>Do you know of an error, whether technical or typographical?</li>
	<li>Do you know of a good resource that could be added to the bibliography -- an explanation, example, original/historical source, relevant humor, ... ?</li>
	<li>Are you able and willing to contribute some text explaining some aspect of a more advanced type class (Category, Comonad, Arrow, ...) in more depth, or more intuitively, than the existing text?</li>
</ul>

To contribute, you can send me email (byorgey at cis dot upenn dot edu).  I'll also be keeping <a href="http://code.haskell.org/~byorgey/typeclassopedia/">this darcs repository</a> up to date, so you're welcome to send me darcs patches as well.
