I haven't written on here in a while, mostly because a lot of my time
has gone into preparing for the second annual [Hendrix College
Programming Contest](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/hcpc/), which will
take place this [Saturday, March 15, from 12:30-5:30pm CDT (17:30-22:30 UTC)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Hendrix+College+Programming+Contest+2025&iso=20250315T1230&p1=134&ah=5).

I've created an [open mirror
contest](https://hcpc25.kattis.com/contests/vxtved) which will run in
parallel to the official contest, so if you want to grab some friends
and try solving some of the problems together using your favorite
language, be my guest!
