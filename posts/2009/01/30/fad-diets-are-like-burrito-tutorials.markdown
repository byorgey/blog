Today at the top of my Gmail inbox was a link with the promise to explain "How I Lost 42 Pounds in 2 Months. Just Obey this 1 Rule, That's All."  It occurred to me that fad diets are like <a href="http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/">monad tutorials</a>.  Of course, since Monads Are Like Burritos (and Tutorial is a functor), it follows that fad diets are like burrito tutorials.  Which makes a certain amount of sense.
