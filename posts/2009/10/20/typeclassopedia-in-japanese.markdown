Satoshi Nakamura has <a href="http://snak.tdiary.net/20091020.html">published a Japanese translation</a> of the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/sitewiki/images/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf">Typeclassopedia</a>.  I don't read any Japanese, but it sure <i>looks</i> cool, and I hope this will be a great resource for Japanese learners of Haskell.  A big thank you to Satoshi for his hard work; the Typeclassopedia is certainly not short!
