I'm excited to be <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/64213/">taking over the editorship</a> of the <a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/">Monad.Reader</a>.  I'll be putting together Issue 15 in January---the <a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/call-for-copy-monad-reader-issue-15/">deadline for submissions</a> will be <b>January 8, 2010</b>.  Please consider writing something!  You don't need to be an expert; past articles have included things like tutorials, book reviews, new ideas, beginner perspectives, illustrations of nifty code, explanations of a new library or piece of software...  Collaboration is encouraged, too.  Have a great idea for an article but not sure you could pull it off for one reason or another?  Send an email to <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mailing_lists">haskell-cafe@haskell.org</a> asking for a coauthor.  Writing an article is a great way to learn and to create a high-quality resource for others learning FP.

If you plan to write something---or are considering it---let me know.  Submission guidelines can be found on the <a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/contributing/">Monad.Reader website</a>.
