I have just submitted a draft article for inclusion in the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Monad.Reader">Monad.Reader</a> entitled "The Typeclassopedia".  I will let the abstract speak for itself:

<blockquote>
The standard Haskell libraries feature a number of type classes with algebraic or categorical underpinnings. Becoming a fluent Haskell hacker requires intimate familiarity with them all, yet acquiring this familiarity often involves combing through a mountain of tutorials, blog posts, mailing list archives, and IRC logs.

The goal of this article is to serve as a starting point for the student of Haskell wishing to gain a firm grasp of its standard type classes. The essentials of each type class are introduced, with examples, commentary, and extensive references for further reading.
</blockquote>

I would love feedback from anyone, from the newest newb to the expertest expert, who would be kind enough to take a look.  Particular types of feedback I would appreciate include:
<ul>
	<li>Are there parts that are confusing or could be worded more clearly?</li>
	<li>Are there parts that are stated incorrectly?</li>
	<li>Do you know of any additional references that could be included?</li>
</ul>
I am looking for more references for Foldable, Traversable, and Comonad in particular, so if you know of any good resources/examples/papers related to any of those, please let me know.

At 48 pages and 110 citations, the article is rather hefty, so I certainly don't expect most people to read through all of it anytime soon---but even if you only take a look at a section or two about which you are particularly interested and/or knowledgeable, your feedback would be greatly appreciated!  I hope that this can become a valuable reference for the Haskell community.

<i>Edit, 16 March 2009:</i> a <a href="http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/monadreader-13-is-out/">revised and updated version of the Typeclassopedia has now been published</a> in the Monad.Reader.
