Later today I'm leaving for a two-week vacation, and I will probably have only very occasional Internet access. If at any point over the next two weeks you wonder why I {didn't moderate your comment, didn't put out the Haskell Weekly News, am not on IRC, am ignoring your email}, you should remember this.

I'll continue writing more about my combinatorial species library when I get back---including recursively defined species, which I'm working on at the moment.
