I'm having a great time in Edinburgh so far!  I'm currently at Heriot-Watt University for the <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/ISS-AiPL/">International Summer School on Advances in Programming Languages</a>, learning some interesting things but more importantly meeting interesting people.  I'm also looking forward to meeting yet more interesting people at <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac7">Hac7</a> and at <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/icfp09.html">ICFP</a> (if you're reading this and plan to be at either, then you are one of them).

Here are <a href="http://yorgeys.smugmug.com/Travel/Edinburgh-2009/">a few pictures I took while sight-seeing</a> on my first day; some pictures of the summer school itself will follow soon.
