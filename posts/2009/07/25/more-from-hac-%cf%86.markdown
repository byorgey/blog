<a href="http://yorgeys.smugmug.com/gallery/9039600_Ra9wn/1/601548513_bBSbf">Yet more pictures</a> from Hac φ!

This afternoon we were treated to talks by Dimitry Golubovsky (typed JavaScript generation), Edward Kmett (monoids library and monoidal parsing), Gershom Bazerman (DSL and quasiquoting for JavaScript generation), and Anton van Straaten (Gitit as an application framework).
