<p>This year I am the co-chair (with <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/">Sam Lindley</a>) of the <a href="http://tydeworkshop.org/2017">Workshop on Type-Driven Development</a>, affectionately known as TyDe<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The workshop will be co-located with <a href="http://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2017">ICFP in Oxford</a>, and is devoted to the use of “static type information…used effectively in the development of computer programs”, construed broadly (see <a href="http://tydeworkshop.org/2017">the CFP</a> for more specific examples of what is in scope). Last year’s workshop drew a relativey large crowd and had a lot of really great papers and talks, and I expect this year to be no different! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-kennedy-3324287">Andrew Kennedy</a> (Facebook UK) will also be giving an invited keynote talk.</p>
<p>Please consider <a href="http://tydeworkshop.org/2017">submitting something</a>! We are looking for both full papers as well as two-page extended abstracts reporting work in progress. The submission deadline for regular papers is 24 May, and 7 June for extended abstracts.</p>
