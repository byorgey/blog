<p>The title pretty much says it all: I have finally finished (I hope) updating the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a> to reflect various recent changes to the language and standard libraries (such as the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor-Applicative-Monad_Proposal">AMP</a> and <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/9586">BBP</a>/<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldable_Traversable_In_Prelude">FTP</a>). Along the way I also added more links to related reading as well as more exercises.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>
<p>I am always on the lookout for more exercises to add and for more links to interesting further reading. If you know of a cool exercise or a cool paper or blog post that helps explain/illustrate/apply a standard Haskell type class, please let me know (or just add it yourself, itâ€™s a wiki!). And, of course, the same goes if you notice any errors or confusing bits.</p>
<p>Happy Haskelling!</p>
