<p>My wife and I just had a baby!</p>

<p>If you missed seeing me at ICFP, this is why.</p>
<p>In honor of my son’s birth (he will need to learn the alphabet and Haskell soon)—and at the instigation of <a href="http://very.science/">Kenny Foner</a>—I revived the <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/haskell-alphabet/">Haskell Alphabet</a> by converting it to modern Hakyll and updating some of the broken or outdated links. Some of it is a bit outdated (I wrote it seven years ago), but it’s still a fun little piece of Haskell history. Enjoy!</p>
