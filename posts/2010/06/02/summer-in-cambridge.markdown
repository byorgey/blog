Today was my last full day in Philadelphia for a little while (spent very enjoyably at the <a href="http://www.philadelphiazoo.org/">US's first zoo</a> and our <a href="http://www.dockstreetbeer.com/DockStreetBeer.html">favorite local pizzeria and brewery</a>).  Tomorrow evening I'm flying to the UK, where I'll be spending three months in Cambridge doing a research internship with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/">Simon Peyton-Jones</a>.  I'll write more specifics about the stuff I'm working on as the summer progresses, but for now suffice it to say that I will be continuing a long tradition of making Haskell as dependently typed as possible without actually making it dependently typed.  If you will be in Cambridge at any point this summer or live nearby and want to meet up, let me know!
