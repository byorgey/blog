I've just submitted a Functional Pearl to <a href="http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2010/">ICFP</a> explaining combinatorial species in a way that is (hopefully) accessible and interesting to functional programmers.  You can <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/papers/species-pearl.pdf">read the draft here</a> -- as always, comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome (although it's too late to help my ICFP chances =).

I plan to upload a new version of my <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/species">species library</a> soon with a ton of major improvements (unlabelled enumeration, and automatically deriving species corresponding to user-defined data types via Template Haskell, to name a couple).  When I do I'll be sure to write about it here!

Also, the paper doesn't mention it, but all the diagrams in the paper were of course generated with <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams">diagrams</a>.
