Today at <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_φ">Hac φ</a> I gave a short talk about the past and future of the <a href="http://code.haskell.org/diagrams/">diagrams library</a>.  For anyone who is interested, I've put the <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/pub/diagrams-hacphi-20100522.pdf">slides up here</a>.  For the actual talk the slides had no text on them, so I've added a summary of what I said at the bottom of each slide (although I've left out some details, so if you've any questions feel free to ask in a comment, or via email).
