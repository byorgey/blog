<a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86">Hac φ 2010</a> is starting tomorrow, and I'm super excited.  I am finally buckling down to do some serious work on the newly redesigned version of <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams">diagrams</a>, and it is going to be sweet.  I know I've been saying that for like a year, so feel free to not believe me until I actually upload something to <a href="http://haskell.org/hackage">Hackage</a>.  But I'm serious.
