My paper on combinatorial species and the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/species">species library</a> (an improved version of my previous <a href="https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2010/04/07/functional-pearl-on-combinatorial-species.html">ICFP submission</a>) has been accepted to the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2010/">2010 Haskell Symposium</a>!  I look forward to seeing people in Baltimore in September, and in the meantime the impatient can <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/papers/species-pearl.pdf">read the final version here</a>.
