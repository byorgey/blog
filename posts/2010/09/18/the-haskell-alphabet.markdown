Here's a little something I've been working on in bits of spare time here and there for the past five months or so:

<a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/haskell-alphabet/">The Haskell Alphabet</a>

I seem to recall it was inspired by a conversation in #haskell around the beginning of April, but I can't find it in the logs.  In any case, enjoy, and feel free to post comments, suggestions for additional links, or alternate stanzas as comments here!
