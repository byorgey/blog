I'm finally back in Philly after attending ICFP, the Haskell Symposium, and the Haskell Implementors' Workshop in Baltimore.  I enjoyed meeting every person I met, so if I met you please feel free to instantiate the universal quantifier.

<ul>
	<li>Here's a link to my Haskell Symposium paper, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/papers/species-pearl.pdf"><i>Species and Functors and Types, Oh My!</i></a>.  My talk seemed to be well-received, and it was videotaped, but unfortunately I think it's going into the ACM Digital Library, which you need a subscription to access.  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/talks/species-hs-20100930.pdf">Here are the slides</a>, at least, although they don't make all that much sense by themselves.  I had several people ask me what I used to make the slides; it was a combination of <a href="http://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a> and my <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams">diagrams EDSL</a>.</li>

	<li>Here are links to the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/talks/typetype-HIW-20101001.pdf">slides</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/15480577">video</a> of my talk from the Haskell Implementors' Workshop, <i>Typed type-level functional programming with GHC</i>.</li>

</ul>
