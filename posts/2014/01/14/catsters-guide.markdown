<p>tl;dr: http://byorgey.wordpress.com/catsters-guide-2/</p>
<p>In an attempt to solidify and extend my knowledge of category theory, I have been working my way through the excellent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters">series of category theory lectures posted on Youtube</a> by <a href="http://www.cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Eugenia Cheng</a> and <a href="http://www.simonwillerton.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Simon Willerton</a>, aka <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/The+Catsters">the Catsters</a>.</p>
<p>Edsko de Vries used to have a listing of the videos, but it is no longer available. After wresting a copy from a Google cache, I began working my way through the videos, but soon discovered that Edskoâ€™s list was organized by subject, <em>not</em> topologically sorted. So I started <a href="http://byorgey.wordpress.com/catsters-guide-2/">making my own list, and have put it up here</a> in the hopes that it may be useful to others. Suggestions, corrections, improvements, <em>etc.</em> are of course welcome!</p>
<p>As far as possible, I have tried to arrange the order so that each video only depends on concepts from earlier ones. Along with each video you can also find my cryptic notes; I make no guarantee that they will be useful to anyone (even me!), but hopefully they will at least give you an idea of what is in each video.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/goals/catsters">a goal</a> to watch two videos per week (at which rate it will take me about nine months to watch all of them); I will keep the list updated with new video links and notes as I go.</p>
