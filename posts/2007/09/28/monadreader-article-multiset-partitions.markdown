I imagine that most who read this blog have already seen it, but for those who haven't, my article <em>Generating Multiset Partitions</em> has been published in <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Monad.Reader">Issue #8 of The Monad.Reader</a>.  In it, I discuss the problem of generating multiset partitions in a functional context, and give an implementation in Haskell.  The final published version contains many major improvements over the draft version I posted here a while ago; give it a read and let me know what you think if you're interested!
