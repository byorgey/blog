On December 28 I'll be hosting the <a href="http://carnivalofmathematics.wordpress.com/">Carnival of Mathematics</a> over at my other blog, <a href="http://www.mathlesstraveled.com">The Math Less Traveled</a>.  If you have any interesting math-related posts you'd like to submit (CS-related posts are fine---even encouraged---as long as there's some sort of mathematical content!), that would be sweet.
