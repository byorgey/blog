For Christmas my parents got me a copy of <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>.  w00t!   I started reading it today on the subway coming home from work.  Unfortunately I'm kind of anal about reading prefaces, introductions and so on, so I haven't gotten to any actual substance yet.  Tomorrow probably.  Now I can finally put into a coherent, rigorous framework all the little bits of knowledge about type systems I've picked up here and there... =)

Also, last call for <a href="http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/?p=95">submissions</a> to the <a href="http://carnivalofmathematics.wordpress.com/">Carnival of Mathematics</a>!  I'll be posting it at midnight Thursday/Friday (or possibly early Friday morning), so it would be great to get submissions by 2pm tomorrow.
