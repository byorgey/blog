<p>If you like number theory, combinatorics, and/or optimizing Haskell code, I challenge you to solve <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/infinite2darray">Infinite 2D Array</a> using Haskell.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: can you come up with a general formula to compute $F_{x,y}$?</li>
<li>Level 2: In general, how can you efficiently compute $F_{x,y} \pmod {10^9 + 7}$?</li>
<li>Level 3: Now implement the above ideas in Haskell so your solution actually fits within the 1 second time limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have solved it but it was definitely challenging. In a subsequent blog post Iâ€™ll talk about my solution and ask for other optimization ideas.</p>
