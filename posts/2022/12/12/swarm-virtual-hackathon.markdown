<p>This Wednesday, December 14, we will have the first (annual? monthly? probably somewhere in between…) Swarm swarm, <em>i.e.</em> collaborative virtual hackathon. Details can be found <a href="https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki/Swarm-swarm">here on the Swarm wiki</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time: <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Swarm+swarm&amp;iso=20221214T14&amp;p1=%3A&amp;ah=9">8am-5pm CST / 9am-6pm EST / 2pm-11pm UTC</a> (feel free to drop in and out any time)</li>
<li>Place: <a href="https://app.gather.town/app/SpqG1ic5pNKM7YqS/The%20Swarm%20Hive">The Swarm Hive on gather.town</a></li>
<li>Who: you! Anyone interested in hacking on Swarm is welcome, from experienced to first-time contributors. If you’ve been thinking of getting involved but haven’t yet, this could be a perfect opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/">Swarm</a> is a 2D, open-world programming and resource gathering game, implemented in Haskell, with a strongly-typed, functional programming language and a unique upgrade system. Unlocking language features is tied to collecting resources, making it an interesting challenge to bootstrap your way into the use of the full language.</p>
