I haven't written here in a while---partly due to being busy, but also
partly due to getting sick of Wordpress and deciding it was finally
time to rebuild my blog from scratch using
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).  I still haven't quite worked
out what I'm doing about comments (I looked into
[Isso](https://isso-comments.de/) but haven't gotten it to work
yet---if you have used it successfully, let me know!).

For today I have two hard competitive programming challenge problems
for you.  Both involve some number theory, and both are fairly
challenging, but that's about all they have in common!

- [Product Divisors](https://open.kattis.com/problems/productdivisors)
- [Factor-Full Tree](https://open.kattis.com/problems/factorfulltree)

Since there are no comments (for now), feel free to email me with your
thoughts.  I'll post my solutions (with commentary) in a later post or
two!
