This Saturday, June 15, we will have the third Swarm swarm, *i.e.*
collaborative virtual hackathon. Details can be found [here on the
Swarm wiki](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki/Swarm-swarm).

* Time: [11am-5pm CDT / 4pm-10pm UTC / 9:30pm-3:30am
  IST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Swarm+swarm+III&iso=20240615T16&p1=1440&ah=6)
  (feel free to drop in and out any time)
* Place: [The Swarm Hive on
  gather.town](https://app.gather.town/app/SpqG1ic5pNKM7YqS/The%20Swarm%20Hive)
* Who: you!  Anyone interested in hacking on Swarm is welcome, from
  experienced to first-time contributors. If you've been thinking of
  getting involved but havenâ€™t yet, this could be a perfect
  opportunity.

As a reminder, [Swarm](https://swarm-game.github.io/) is a 2D,
open-world programming and resource gathering game, implemented in
Haskell, with a strongly-typed, functional programming language and a
unique upgrade system. Unlocking language features is tied to
collecting resources, making it an interesting challenge to bootstrap
your way into the use of the full language.
