**tl;dr**: if you appreciate my past or ongoing contributions to the
Haskell community, please consider helping me get to ICFP this year by [donating
via my ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/byorgey)!

Working at a [small liberal arts institution](https://www.hendrix.edu/)
has some tremendous benefits (close interaction with motivated students,
freedom to pursue the projects I want rather than jump through a bunch
of hoops to get tenure, fantastic colleagues), and I love my job. But
there are also downsides; the biggest ones for me are the difficulty of
securing enough travel funding, and, relatedly, the difficulty of
cultivating and maintaining collaborations.

[Last
year](https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2023/05/22/new-ko-fi-page-help-me-attend-icfp.html)
I was very grateful for people's generosity in helping me get to
Seattle.  I am planning to again attend [ICFP in Milan this
September](https://icfp24.sigplan.org/); this time I will even bring
some students along.  I have once again secured some funding from my
institution, but it will not be enough to cover all the expenses.

So, if you have been positively impacted by my
contributions to the Haskell community (*e.g.* [CIS
194](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/), the
[Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia),
[diagrams](https://diagrams.github.io/),
[split](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split),
[MonadRandom](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MonadRandom), [burrito
metaphors](https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy.html)...)
and/or would like to support my ongoing work ([competitive programming
in
Haskell](https://byorgey.github.io/blog/tag/Kattis.html),
[swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/#readme),
[disco](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/#readme), [ongoing package
maintenance](https://hackage.haskell.org/user/BrentYorgey)...), and are
able to express that appreciation or support with a [donation of any
size](https://ko-fi.com/byorgey) to help me get to ICFP, I would really appreciate it!

Thank you, friends --- I hope to see many people in Milan! Next up:
I will soon publish another post about [tree path decomposition](https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2024/07/11/cpih-factor-full-tree.html)!
