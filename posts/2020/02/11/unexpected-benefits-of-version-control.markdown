<p>Last night I dreamed that I had shaved off my mustache, and my wife was not happy about it. But in the dream, I couldn’t remember when or why I had shaved. Suddenly, it occurred to me: when I merged those old git commits I must have accidentally merged one that updated my mustache. “Thank goodness for version control,” I thought, as I went to revert that commit. Then I woke up.</p>
