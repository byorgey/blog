<p>I forgot to mention this in my previous post, but the thing which got me thinking about the predecessor problem in the first place was this competitive programming problem on Open Kattis:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/profitablepizzas">Profitable Pizzas</a></p>
</div>
<p>I challenge you to go and solve it using your favorite technique from the <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2020/04/06/data-structure-challenge-solutions/">previous post</a>. (The connection between this Kattis problem and the predecessor problem is not immediately obvious, but I have to leave you something to puzzle over!)</p>
