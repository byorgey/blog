A couple months ago, [I asked for
help](https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2025/11/10/disco-web-ui.html)
creating a web interface for
[Disco](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco), a
student-oriented programming language for teaching functional
programming and discrete mathematics.  I am very happy to report that
[Heinrich Apfelmus](https://apfelmus.nfshost.com/) responded to the
call, and this is the result:

[Disco Live!](https://disco-lang.github.io/disco-live/)

It's fairly bare bones at the moment, but it's a fantastic place to
start, and far more than I would have been able to accomplish in a few
weeks. Give it a try, and let me know of any bugs you find!  You are
also very welcome to contribute fixes, features, etc. on GitHub:

* [The disco-live repo](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco-live)
* [The repo for disco itself](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco)

If you want to know more about Disco, you can [read a paper about it
here](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/forest/yorgey-disco-2023/index.xml),
or [read the language documentation](https://disco-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
