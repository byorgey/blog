<p>I’m helping organize a new workshop, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/farm13/">FARM</a>, to be held in Boston this September (right after ICFP). Many readers of this blog may have already seen the announcement, but I thought it worth saying a bit more about it here, in the spirit of trying to spread the word as widely as possible.</p>
<p>The short of it is—it should be super interesting and a lot of fun. If you are at all interested in the intersection of functional programming and design, art, music—anything that has to do with using <strong>beautiful code to produce beautiful artifacts</strong>—you should consider submitting a paper, or planning to attend! Papers can be submitted in two categories, full papers novel research contribution) and “aesthetic applications” (which should describe some sort of beautiful way to produce something beautiful). The deadline for submissions is June 14. See <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/farm13/">the website</a> for more details.</p>
