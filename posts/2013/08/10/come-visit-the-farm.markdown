<a href="https://regmaster3.com/2013conf/ICFP13/register.php">Registration is now open</a> for the first (!) <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/farm13/">ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design (FARM)</a>, to be held in Boston on September 28 (the day after ICFP).  I'm really excited---it's shaping up to be a really awesome event.   Check out the list of accepted papers and demos:

</ul>

Note the early registration deadline is August 22, so don't delay!  In case you're not already convinced, here's a short description of the workshop and what it's trying to accomplish:

<p>The functional programming community is largely interested in writing beautiful programs. This workshop is intended to gather researchers and practitioners interested in writing <em>beautiful programs that generate beautiful artifacts</em>. Such artifacts may include visual art, music, 3D sculptures, animations, GUIs, video games, physical models, architectural models, choreographies for dance, poetry, and even physical objects such as VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical engineering designs.</p>
<p>The goal of FARM is to gather together researchers, practitioners, and educators in this interdisciplinary field, as well as anyone else with even a casual interest in the area. We wish to share ideas, look for common ground, and encourage more activity. We also hope to legitimize work in the field and facilitate potential collaboration among the participants.</p>
